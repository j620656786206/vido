## Story

As a frontend maintainer,
I want a Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` visual baseline (default / hover / focus / open where applicable) for every remaining in-scope `apps/web/src/components/` component — and the three harness-quality fixes Sally flagged on 19-4 — so that the epic-19 visual-regression net covers the *whole* component surface (not just the ~25 reference set 19-4 shipped) and produces faithful per-state baselines before 19-8's component-vs-`.pen` diff sweep and any Rule 22 retro audit relies on it (and before 19-5's CI workflow goes live against drift-prone baselines).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Harness-quality fixes from the 19-4 Sally review (Task 0) are landed BEFORE any new fixture/baseline is generated** — they affect every baseline this story produces. The visual spec must (a) use *keyboard-driven* focus (sentinel + `Tab`, or equivalent) so Chromium flags the modality as keyboard and `:focus-visible` rules paint; (b) cover the `TabNavigation` active-tab state (stub `useRouterState` via a nested memory `RouterProvider` in the gallery wrapper, or render the fixture under a route whose pathname matches `TABS.matchPaths`); (c) support an `open` interactive state via an optional per-fixture `openTrigger?: string` selector — gallery emits `<div data-gallery-state="open" data-gallery-open-trigger="…">`, the spec clicks the trigger inside the state div before screenshotting. The three affected 19-4 baselines (`media-poster-card/focus`, `library-filter-chips/focus`, `library-sort-selector/focus`, `library-view-toggle/focus`, `metadata-editor-genre-selector/focus`, `search-search-bar/focus`, `search-media-type-tabs/focus`, `shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}`, `ui-button/focus`, `ui-pagination/focus`) are regenerated and re-committed in the same commit as the spec change.

2. **Every `apps/web/src/components/**/*.tsx` component that renders visible UI and is not already in `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` gets a fixture entry there.** Fixture shape: `{ id, label, component, props?, penNode, statesOnly?, width?, openTrigger?, seedQueries? }` — `penNode` from the component's `// Implements:` header (`_bmad-output/audit/drift-19-3-2026-05.md` mapping; `'screen-section'` / `'utility'` for the placeholder/exemption forms). Reuse each component's own `*.spec.tsx` mock-data shapes; data-driven components get their React-Query keys seeded (Task 3 — extend the gallery route with a `<GalleryQuerySeed>` helper or take a per-fixture `seedQueries: Array<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` and call `queryClient.setQueryData(...)` before render). Components depending on Zustand stores (e.g. `library-filters-store`, `selection-store`) get their store seeded the same way (per-fixture `seedStore?: () => void` hook, called before mount).

3. **Sally (UX) reviews the rendered gallery (`/test/gallery`) before the baseline set is committed.** The story records the review in Completion Notes (mirror the 19-4 AC #5 Sally-gate). `pnpm run test:visual:update` regenerates all PNGs (existing 46 + new ones for the bulk fill); `pnpm run test:visual` is green on a clean re-run; burn-in (`test:visual` ×5) shows 0 flake. Every committed PNG path follows the harness convention: `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/{gallery-id}/{state}-visual-{platform}.png`.

4. **Deliberate skips are recorded with reasons in `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md`.** Known skips (carry over from 19-4): type/util modules `parse/types.ts`, `degradation/types.ts`, `downloads/formatters.ts`; the misfiled hook `parse/useParseProgress.ts`; bare layout shells (`shell/AppShell`, `dashboard/DashboardLayout`, `settings/SettingsLayout`, `setup/SetupWizard`) — rendered only if a sensible isolated fixture exists, otherwise listed in the audit doc with one-line reasons. The audit doc's **Delivered** table is updated to the full set and the **Pending** section is emptied (or lists only documented skips).

5. **Platform / CI: the Linux-baseline strategy 19-5 needs is decided and implemented.** Either (a) commit a `-linux` set generated in the CI Docker image via a new `scripts/visual-baseline.sh` (cross-platform helper), OR (b) document — in `tests/visual/README.md` + the audit doc — that 19-5's CI job regenerates the `-linux` set via `pnpm run test:visual:update` in a one-off commit. The decision is recorded in Completion Notes with rationale, so 19-5 can wire CI without re-litigating it.

6. **Regression gates green at story close:** `pnpm lint:all` 0 errors / 122 warnings (the bugfix-10-7 / 19-3 / 19-4 baseline); `pnpm nx test web` + `pnpm nx test api` pass; `pnpm test:e2e --list` count unchanged from 1663 / 36 files (the `visual` project stays excluded); `pnpm run test:cleanup` shows no orphans; `ux-design.pen` untouched (so `scripts/export-pen-screenshots.py` is not run and the CLAUDE.md screenshot workflow does not trigger). The new fixture entries + spec/gallery changes pass ESLint + Prettier — no new warnings in the changed files relative to the closeout baseline.

## Tasks / Subtasks

> **Scope (Party Mode 2026-05-12 ruling, inherited):** ALL frontend / 0 backend → single story (cross-stack split check N/A). 19-4's `[@contract-v1]` harness ACs are *consumed* not extended; the only contract-shape change is the additive `openTrigger?` / `seedQueries?` / `seedStore?` fields on `GalleryFixture` — documented as a harness extension, no new `[@contract-vN]` stamp.

### Task 0: Harness-quality fixes from 19-4 Sally review — DO THESE FIRST (AC: #1)

These fixes change spec/fixture behaviour and therefore every baseline 19-4b generates. Land Task 0 atomically (one commit) and regenerate the affected 19-4 focus baselines in the same commit. Burn-in test:visual ×3 after the changes to confirm 0 flake before moving to Task 1.

- [x] **0a. Fix A — Keyboard-driven `focus` state (Sally follow-up #1).** Programmatic `locator.focus()` does not trigger Chromium's `:focus-visible` rules; replaced with a sentinel-then-Tab pattern so input modality flips to keyboard.
  - [x] `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx`: hidden `<button type="button" data-gallery-sentinel="pre" aria-hidden="true" tabIndex={0} className="sr-only" />` rendered immediately before each `<div data-gallery-state>`.
  - [x] `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts`: `state === 'focus'` branch uses `stateDiv.locator('xpath=preceding-sibling::*[@data-gallery-sentinel="pre"][1]')` then `await sentinel.focus()` + `await page.keyboard.press('Tab')`. Programmatic-focus fallback retained for fixtures with no focusable descendant. Spec header doc-comment updated to reference 19-4b Task 0.
  - [x] Regenerated affected baselines via `pnpm run test:visual:update`. **Of the 10 existing 3-state focus baselines, ONLY `search-search-bar/focus-visual-darwin.png` changed pixel-wise** — the SearchBar's input is the only fixture whose CSS distinguishes `:focus-visible` from `:focus`. The other 9 (ui-button, library-filter-chips, library-sort-selector, library-view-toggle, media-poster-card, metadata-editor-genre-selector, search-media-type-tabs, shell-tab-navigation, ui-pagination) render identically under both → re-blessed unchanged (Playwright didn't rewrite them). Expected per Sally's review note ("many components have identical `:focus` and `:focus-visible` styles").

- [x] **0b. Fix B — TabNavigation active-tab state (Sally follow-up #2).** Implemented **Option B1 — nested memory `RouterProvider`** (preferred per the story spec; sibling-route Option B2 rejected because it would drag in shell-layout data dependencies).
  - [x] `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx`: added `STUB_TAB_PATHS = ['/library', '/downloads', '/pending', '/settings'] as const` + `StubbedRouter` component that builds a memory router (`createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [pathname] })`) with all 4 TAB paths registered as stub child routes whose `component` renders the wrapped fixture. `useRouterState()` inside the wrapped component resolves through the inner provider → reports the stub path → `TabActive (TboA7)` paints. TS shape-mismatch on `RouterProvider router={...}` suppressed with `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` + cast (the stub router's typed tree is intentionally narrower than the main `routeTree.gen.ts`; runtime context lookup is correct).
  - [x] `useMemo` dep list intentionally omits `children` (each fixture mounts once for the snapshot; re-creating the router on prop change would thrash history subscriptions). `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppressed with a deliberate comment.
  - [x] `-gallery.fixtures.tsx`: `shell-tab-navigation` FIXME block removed; `routePath: '/library'` added. `GalleryFixture` interface gained `routePath?: StubRoutePath` field (typed as `'/library' | '/downloads' | '/pending' | '/settings'`).
  - [x] Regenerated `shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}-visual-darwin.png` — all 3 now render with `媒體庫 (/library)` tab styled active (blue underline + white text per `TabNavigation.tsx:38-41`).

- [x] **0c. Fix C — Interactive `open` state via `openTrigger` (Sally follow-up #3).**
  - [x] `GalleryFixture` extended: `'open'` added to `GalleryState` union; `openTrigger?: string` field added (CSS selector relative to the component's render).
  - [x] `gallery.tsx`: `requestedStates.filter((s) => s !== 'open' || !!fx.openTrigger)` silently drops the `open` state for fixtures without a trigger. The `open` state div renders `data-gallery-open-trigger={fx.openTrigger}` so the spec can read it.
  - [x] `components.visual.spec.ts`: new `else if (state === 'open')` branch reads `data-gallery-open-trigger`, clicks the selector inside the state div, then **waits for any `:is([role="listbox"], [role="menu"], [role="dialog"])` to be visible** with a 1s timeout + `.catch(() => {})` fallback (this `waitFor` is the burn-in stabilizer — the initial implementation without it produced 1 visual fail in 4 burn-in runs; the wait kills the screenshot-vs-popup-paint race).
  - [x] `library-sort-selector` fixture: `statesOnly: ['default', 'hover', 'focus', 'open']` + `openTrigger: '[data-testid="sort-selector-button"]'` opted in — the reference case for the `open` mechanism. New baseline `library-sort-selector/open-visual-darwin.png` captures the open `SortDropdown 955EZ` panel (`role="listbox" aria-label="排序選項"`, 4 options visible).
  - [ ] DEFERRED to next 19-4b iteration: inventorying other 19-4 reference fixtures for opt-in (Sally review only flagged SortDropdown explicitly; other 19-4 fixtures don't have an obvious `openTrigger`). Task 1 will identify Q/S-bucket modal/dropdown components and they'll opt in per-fixture.
  - [ ] DEFERRED to next 19-4b iteration: `tests/visual/README.md` update for the `open` state + `openTrigger` field. The interface is documented in `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` JSDoc which is the primary discovery surface; README polish will batch with the Task 4 / Task 6 doc pass.

- [x] **0d. Burn-in + commit.** Post-stabilization burn-in: `pnpm run test:visual` ×4 consecutive runs → 4 PASS / 0 visual content failures (1 webServer-startup infrastructure timeout during rapid back-to-back runs — not a visual flake; standalone runs are 14–32 s). Pre-stabilization had 1 visual fail in 4 runs (the open-state click-then-screenshot race that the `waitFor` in Fix C addresses). Lint `0/122`, Prettier clean on all 3 touched code files, feature-E2E `--list` 1663 tests / 36 files unchanged. Audit doc Delivered-baselines table NOT updated this commit (header still reads `(25 unique components / 26 fixture entries / 46 PNGs)`) — Task 6 owns the audit-doc full-set update; Task 0's incremental delta (`+1 fixture entry: library-sort-selector now has 4 states; +1 new PNG: library-sort-selector/open; 4 baselines re-blessed: search-search-bar/focus + shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}` ⇒ **26 fixture entries / 27 entry-state combinations / 47 PNGs**) is recorded here. Commit message: `feat(19-4b): Task 0 harness-quality fixes — Sally follow-ups 1/2/3`.

### Task 1: Inventory remaining components & bucket data-driven vs. presentational (AC: #2, #4)

- [x] Generate the full in-scope list. Quick recipe (record exact commands run in Debug Log References):
  ```bash
  # All .tsx components, minus tests/index barrels
  find apps/web/src/components -name '*.tsx' ! -name '*.spec.tsx' ! -name '*.test.tsx' \
    ! -name 'index.ts' | sort > /tmp/all-components.txt
  # Already-covered fixture ids → component-paths (reverse the kebab → path mapping)
  grep -oE "'[a-z][a-z0-9-]+'" apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx \
    | head -n 200 > /tmp/covered-ids.txt
  ```
- [x] For each not-yet-covered component, classify into one of FOUR buckets — record the bucket in a working notes section under "Debug Log References":
  - **P (Presentational)** — pure props-in, no `useQuery` / `useMutation` / store reads / router reads. → goes in Task 2.
  - **Q (Query-driven)** — needs React-Query data. → goes in Task 3 (seed via `seedQueries`).
  - **S (Store-driven)** — reads from a Zustand store (selection, library-filters, etc.). → goes in Task 3 (seed via `seedStore`).
  - **L (Layout shell / no isolated render)** — `AppShell`, `DashboardLayout`, `SettingsLayout`, `SetupWizard`, etc. → recorded as deliberate skip per AC #4 unless a trivial isolated fixture exists.
- [x] Confirm the four type/util-only files stay skipped (`parse/types.ts`, `degradation/types.ts`, `downloads/formatters.ts`, `parse/useParseProgress.ts`) — these were skipped in 19-4 and remain skipped here.
- [x] Cross-check the inventory against `_bmad-output/audit/drift-19-3-2026-05.md` Category-A/B/C tables — any newly-classified Category-A (real `.pen` Reusable-Component mapping) gets that node id in its fixture's `penNode`; everything else uses `'screen-section'` (the 19-3 Phase-2 placeholder) or `'utility'`.

### Task 2: Add fixtures — Presentational bucket first (AC: #2)

- [x] For each P-bucket component, add a fixture entry. Reuse the component's own `*.spec.tsx` mock-data shapes for props (do not re-invent — Rule per `project-context.md`). The `penNode` value MUST come from the component file's `// Implements:` header (Rule 21-enforced by `local/implements-pen-node-id` ESLint rule). **63 entries added** across 17 subfolders (see Debug Log "Task 2 bulk fill" + the File List).
- [x] Group fixtures in the file by `components/` subfolder (the existing convention — `ui/` → `media/` → `degradation/` → `library/` → …). Keep one-fixture-per-line readable formatting (Prettier handles wrapping). Order: `ui/` → `media/` → `degradation/` → `dashboard/` → `downloads/` → `library/` → `homepage/` → `learning/` → `manual-search/` → `metadata-editor/` → `notifications/` → `parse/` → `retry/` → `scanner/` → `search/` → `settings/` → `setup/`.
- [x] For badges / skeletons / static labels: `statesOnly: ['default']` (no meaningful hover/focus). For interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs): keep the default three states. Applied per-fixture (see entries with `statesOnly: ['default']` for: ui-dialog, ui-highlight-text, ui-side-panel, media-{credits,fallback-failed,fallback-pending,file-info,media-grid,tv-show-info}, all degradation/, downloads-{download-parse-status-badge,status-icon}, library-{batch-confirm-dialog,batch-progress,parse-failure-card→no this kept default-only no; actually kept default-only? see file}, all notifications/, parse-{layered-progress,parse-status-badge}, retry-countdown-timer, scanner-{progress-card,progress-sheet}, search-search-results, settings-{backup-table,connection-test-result,restore-confirm-dialog,settings-placeholder}, setup-step-progress).
- [x] For inline / auto-width components that would collapse to 0-width in isolation (badges, chips): set a sensible `width` (typically 200–640 px). Applied to 47 of 63 entries (5 entries are full-page setup steps that don't need a width; ui-side-panel + library-batch-confirm-dialog + library-batch-progress + settings-restore-confirm-dialog are fixed-position overlays that don't need width; the remaining bare-default entries are intentionally letting the natural width win).
- [x] Spot-check renders in `pnpm nx serve web` → `/test/gallery`. **Method**: Playwright probe (`.gallery-probe.mjs`, deleted post-check) against the running dev server. **Result**: 89 `[data-gallery-id]` sections present (26 pre-existing + 63 new = 89 ✓); **0 `[data-gallery-error]` placeholders**; 2 console errors (HTTP 500 on `/api/v1/setup/status` + one other — pre-existing app-shell calls, not Task 2 fixtures). First probe pass surfaced a transient Radix Dialog `Invalid hook call` for `ui-dialog` from Vite's optimizeDeps cache warming during HMR; second probe pass after Vite cache settled was clean. **Caveat**: `ui-dialog` renders an empty state-div because Radix `DialogContent` portals to `document.body` (outside the fixture's snapshot crop); Task 4 baseline generation + Sally review will decide whether to keep, drop, or rewrite the fixture with a non-portal wrapper. Same caveat applies to `ui-side-panel` (fixed-position viewport overlay).

### Task 3: Add fixtures — Query-driven & Store-driven buckets (AC: #2)

- [x] **Extend the gallery infrastructure** (one set of edits to `gallery.tsx` + `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` before adding Q/S fixtures):
  - [x] Add `seedQueries?: ReadonlyArray<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` and `seedStore?: () => void` to the `GalleryFixture` interface. (Used `ReadonlyArray` not `Array` so existing call-sites with `as const`-typed key tuples don't need to widen.)
  - [x] In the gallery route, before rendering each fixture: if `fx.seedQueries`, call `queryClient.setQueryData(qk, data)` for each entry. **Chose the `<GalleryFixtureSeed>` WRAPPER COMPONENT pattern** (clean) over inlined seeding (lighter). Rationale: the seeding side-effect is centralised in one place where it can carry a docstring explaining the "useState init runs before children mount" semantics; inlined seeding would have scattered the same `queryClient.setQueryData(...)` call through the render loop with no obvious owner for the docstring. Also lets the seed wrapper grow extra responsibilities (e.g. `seedStore` + future router stubs) without bloating the section render. Seeds fire synchronously via `useState(() => { ... })` initializer — this runs ONCE during the first render of the wrapper, BEFORE the children's render subtree commits, so `useQuery()` calls inside the children see the seeded data on their first read (no `isLoading` flash, no network attempt to fall back from). `seedStore` is called inside the same `useState` init for forward compatibility (no S-bucket consumers today).
  - [x] Decide whether to introduce a `<GalleryQuerySeed>` wrapper component (clean) or inline the seeding (lighter) — recorded in subtask above: chose the wrapper, named it `GalleryFixtureSeed` (broader than just queries since it also seeds stores).
- [x] For each Q-bucket component, populate `seedQueries` with the keys the component reads. **34 Q-bucket components fixtured** (35th — `scanner/ScanProgress` — documented as deliberate skip per AC #4, see Debug Log "Task 3 deliberate skips"). Method: 5 parallel general-purpose subagents per subfolder bucket each read the component `.tsx` (for `useQuery`/custom-hook calls), the corresponding hook file (`apps/web/src/hooks/use*.ts` for the `*Keys` builder), the component's `.spec.tsx` (for the canonical mock-data shape per project-context.md Rule 5), and `_bmad-output/audit/drift-19-3-2026-05.md` (for `penNode`). All 34 land in Category-C → `penNode: 'screen-section'`.
- [x] For S-bucket components, write a small `seedStore` lambda. **NONE this story** — Task 1 inventory found 0 S-bucket consumers under `components/` (project-context Rule 5: stores live at the route level, not component level). The `seedStore?: () => void` interface field + `GalleryFixtureSeed`'s `useState`-init invocation are in place for forward compatibility; no fixture uses it today.
- [x] Components rendering inside a `Dialog` / `SidePanel` / portal: render them in `open: true` state directly. Applied to the 4 dialog/overlay Q-bucket components: `manual-search/ManualSearchDialog`, `metadata-editor/MetadataEditorDialog`, `subtitle/SubtitleSearchDialog` (all custom `fixed inset-0` overlays — NOT Radix portals, render inline when open=true), and `settings/{ExploreBlockEditModal,LibraryEditModal}` (same inline-fixed pattern). `health/ConnectionHistoryPanel` wraps in `SidePanel` (also `fixed inset-0`, not portaled). All five are `statesOnly: ['default']` since hover/focus on a viewport-fixed overlay is noisy. **NONE of the 34 use Radix Portal** — Task 2's `ui/Dialog` portal caveat does not recur in Task 3.
- [x] PosterCardMenu, kebab menus, etc. — use `openTrigger` to click the trigger button. **N/A for the Task 3 batch** — the kebab/dropdown consumers (`library/PosterCardMenu`, `library/SortSelector`, `library/SettingsGearDropdown`, `media/DetailPanelMenu`) were all Task 2 P-bucket fixtures and already opt in to the `open` state via `openTrigger`. None of Task 3's Q-bucket components expose an `openTrigger`-shaped affordance — they're either full panels (`*Dashboard`, `*Manager`, `*Panel`) or fixed-overlay dialogs (covered above).

### Task 4: Generate full baseline set, UX review, commit; burn-in (AC: #3)

- [ ] Run `pnpm run test:visual:update` — produces all new PNGs under `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/{id}/{state}-visual-darwin.png`. Spot-check rendering quality at `pnpm nx serve web` → `/test/gallery` (you should see every component render without error placeholders).
- [ ] Triage any fixture-error placeholders: a `[data-gallery-error]` on a fixture means props are misshapen or a hook crashed → fix the fixture's props/seed, regenerate, do **not** ship a baseline for an error state.
- [ ] **Sally /ux-designer reviews the rendered gallery.** Record the review in Completion Notes ("🎨 UX Verification" subsection — mirror the 19-4 closeout's format). Any rendering issues flagged → return to Task 2/3 to fix the offending fixture(s), regenerate, re-review. Sally's review IS the AC #3 close gate.
- [ ] Burn-in: `pnpm run test:visual` ×5 → 0 flake. If any flake surfaces, identify the offending fixture (Playwright's `--max-failures=1` + the failure trace), suppress non-determinism (animations leaking past `reducedMotion: 'reduce'`, async-only render paths the gallery enters before they settle, etc.).
- [ ] Commit baselines + fixture additions. The story-19-4 commit-message style applies: `feat(19-4b): bulk-fill ~99 component visual baselines`. Per the harness baseline-update discipline (`tests/visual/README.md`), do NOT mix baseline churn with logic changes — pure-fixture commits only.

### Task 5: Linux-baseline strategy for CI (AC: #5)

- [ ] Decide between **(a)** `scripts/visual-baseline.sh` Docker helper, or **(b)** document CI-regenerate-on-first-run:
  - **(a) `scripts/visual-baseline.sh`**: thin wrapper that `docker run`s the same image 19-5 will use (the existing Playwright image — `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v$PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION-jammy` matches the project's `@playwright/test` version) with `tests/visual/` mounted and runs `pnpm run test:visual:update`. Output: PNGs with `-linux` suffix. 19-5 then commits both `-darwin` + `-linux` sets and CI verifies `-linux`. *Cleaner long-term; requires Docker on dev machine.*
  - **(b) Document CI-regen**: leave only `-darwin` baselines committed; 19-5's CI workflow runs `test:visual:update` on first execution, commits the `-linux` set in a one-off PR, then runs in verify-only mode thereafter. *Simpler now; one-time CI commit at 19-5 close.*
- [ ] Update `tests/visual/README.md` with the chosen strategy under "Baseline-update discipline" → "Platform suffix" — keep the existing language for the strategy NOT chosen as a "rejected alternative" footnote so 19-5's owner sees both options.
- [ ] Update `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md` "Platform suffix" line to match.

### Task 6: Update audit doc to full set; full regression + close (AC: #4, #6)

- [ ] Update `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md`:
  - [ ] "Delivered baselines" table: append all new bulk-fill rows (one per fixture id); update the header count to "(N unique components / M fixture entries / K PNGs)" with the actual totals.
  - [ ] "Pending (19-4b worklist — ~99 components, NOT design-drift findings)" section: replace the worklist with a "Delivered in 19-4b 2026-05-..." closure note + the deliberate-skips list (still recorded per AC #4).
  - [ ] "Material drift findings (Rule 22)" section: stays "None this story" — 19-4b is still building the diff tool, not running the diff (19-8 owns that).
- [ ] Full regression: `pnpm lint:all` 0 errors / 122 warnings; `pnpm nx test web` + `pnpm nx test api` pass; `pnpm test:e2e --list` 1663 tests / 36 files unchanged; `pnpm run test:visual` green (full new baseline set); `pnpm run test:cleanup` no orphans; `ux-design.pen` unmodified.
- [ ] Update sprint-status.yaml: 19-4b `in-progress` → `review` with a Completion Notes-style summary line.
- [ ] Set Story Status to `review`. CR /code-review runs next (different LLM-context per workflow tip).

## Dev Notes

### Why this story exists / where it sits in epic-19

- **bugfix-10-4 root cause** (Party Mode 2026-05-08): `HoverPreviewCard.tsx` diverged from `.pen` `Component/PosterCardHover` (node `MQbvp`) undetected for months. Epic-19 is the systemic fix. **19-1** added Rule 21 to `project-context.md`; **19-2** added Rule 22; **19-3** made Rule 21 CI-enforced via `local/implements-pen-node-id` + header backfill across all 131 `components/` files (12 Category-A → real `.pen` nodes; 25 `<utility — no .pen counterpart>`; 94 `<screen-section — pending epic-19-8 mapping>`). **19-4** delivered the visual-regression *harness* + 25 reference fixtures + 46 baselines + Sally sign-off (closed 2026-05-13, `7d7a6b2`). **This story (19-4b)** bulk-fills the remaining ~99 components and lands the three harness-quality fixes Sally flagged on 19-4 (Task 0). **19-5** wires the harness into PR-scoped CI. **19-8** runs the full component-vs-`.pen` diff and files `bugfix-N` for material drift. Rule 22 epic retros use `pnpm run test:visual` as the diff tool.
- **Dependency:** depends on **19-4 (done)** — the harness (`visual` Playwright project, `test:visual*` scripts, gallery route, `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` shape, `data-gallery-id`/`data-pen-node` convention, `FixtureErrorBoundary` per-fixture pattern, `[@contract-v1]` harness ACs). No upstream Rule 20 ack needed: 19-4's `[@contract-v1]` AC #1–#5 are consumed *unchanged* (the spec's `focus` branch is being replaced, but the public harness contract — `visual` project name, npm scripts, gallery wrapper attributes, baseline path — is intact). 19-3's `[@contract-v2]` covers the `// Implements:` marker grammar; 19-4b reads the produced `.pen`-node mapping (an audit doc, not a versioned AC) → implicit-v0, ack-skipped per Rule 20.

### Architecture / constraints — read before implementing

- **All frontend.** 0 Go, 0 migrations, 0 swagger, 0 backend tests. Cross-stack split check: backend task count = 0 → single story is correct (the `>3 each side` threshold is not met).
- **No Storybook, no Playwright component-testing in this repo.** The 19-4 ruling stands: dev-only TanStack Router gallery route + the existing Playwright runner. Do NOT add `@playwright/experimental-ct-react` or any other new test-framework dep.
- **No `apps/web/src/components/` edits.** The `local/implements-pen-node-id` rule (19-3) is silent because this story touches only `routes/test/*` (route-only — Rule 21 exempt) and `tests/visual/*` (tests — Rule 21 exempt). If you find yourself wanting to add a `data-testid` to a component to make a fixture work, **stop**: that's a 19-8-style finding, not something to patch here. Use the `<section data-gallery-id>` wrapper in the *route* instead. (One exception: if a component is genuinely unrenderable in isolation without a prop it doesn't expose, flag it back to the SM — it's a 19-8 candidate, not 19-4b's problem.)
- **Determinism is everything for visual tests** (project-context Rule 16 + the bugfix-10-3 StrictMode lesson + the 19-4 harness): `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` + `animations: 'disabled'` kill CSS transitions (Vido's hover/focus states are pure CSS — `lg:group-hover:*`, `focus-visible:*`); fixed `viewport` 1280×800; `colorScheme: 'dark'` (Vido has no light theme); `caret: 'hide'`; `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.001`. **Seeded data ⇒ no network calls** — if a Q-fixture is hitting the network during snapshot, that's a missed `queryKey` in `seedQueries` (or a `staleTime: 0` somewhere). Use Playwright's `page.route('**/api/v1/**', route => route.abort())` only as a last-resort safety net; the right answer is to seed correctly.
- **`:focus-visible` vs `:focus`**: only `:focus-visible` paints the visible focus ring in Vido's styles. Programmatic `.focus()` does not trigger `:focus-visible` in Chromium; keyboard-driven focus (Tab from the sentinel) does. Task 0 Fix A is the canonical fix. Some components have identical `:focus` and `:focus-visible` styles → their focus baselines won't visibly change post-fix; that's expected, capture them anyway for completeness.
- **`useRouterState`-dependent components**: see Task 0 Fix B. The nested memory-`RouterProvider` is the cleaner of the two options because it isolates the stub to the one fixture that needs it; sibling route files (Option B2) drag in shell layout etc.
- **`routes/test/` and the prod bundle**: the gallery + sentinel button + any new sibling `-tabnav-*.tsx` files (Option B2) get `import.meta.env.PROD` short-circuit guarding (the 19-4 CR M1 fix in `gallery.tsx:31-37`). Mirror that pattern in any new test-route file; do NOT rely on the `hostname === 'localhost'` clause alone.
- **Platform suffix**: this story's commit lands `-darwin` (or `-linux` if you switch the dev machine first); 19-5 will own cross-platform parity per Task 5's chosen strategy.
- **`tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts` is the only spec.** Do NOT split into multiple specs per component-group (the DOM-driven worklist pattern is core to "adding a component = adding a fixture entry, nothing else"). The spec already discovers state divs from the DOM; new states (like `open`) just need a new `else if` branch in the state-handling chain.

### Fixture patterns — quick reference

```ts
// Presentational (P bucket) — no data dependencies
{
  id: 'category-component-name',
  label: 'category/ComponentName',
  component: ComponentName as ComponentType<Record<string, unknown>>,
  props: { /* match the component's *.spec.tsx mock shape */ },
  penNode: 'XXXXX',           // from `// Implements:` header (drift-19-3-2026-05.md)
  // statesOnly: ['default'], // for badges/skeletons
  // width: 320,              // for inline/auto-width components
}

// Query-driven (Q bucket) — needs React-Query seed
{
  id: 'homepage-hero-banner',
  ...
  seedQueries: [
    { queryKey: ['library', 'movies', { /* filters */ }] as const, data: { items: [/* 3 mock movies */] } },
    { queryKey: ['tmdb', 'trending'] as const, data: [/* mock */] },
  ],
}

// Interactive open state (Fix C)
{
  id: 'library-poster-card-menu',
  ...
  statesOnly: ['default', 'open'],
  openTrigger: '[data-testid="poster-card-menu-trigger"]',
}

// Store-driven (S bucket)
{
  id: 'library-selection-toolbar',
  ...
  seedStore: () => useSelectionStore.setState({ selectedIds: new Set(['m1', 'm2', 'm3']), mode: 'select' }),
}

// Router-dependent (Fix B Option B1)
{
  id: 'shell-tab-navigation',
  ...
  routePath: '/library',  // nested memory router initial entry
}
```

### Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Don't snapshot a `[data-gallery-error]` placeholder.** If a fixture errors, fix the fixture; do not commit an error-state baseline (the spec already skips them, but `:update` won't — verify visually that `pnpm run test:visual:update` didn't write an error PNG by spot-checking `/test/gallery`).
- **Don't add an `inert` prop to gallery sections** to "freeze" interactive state — the gallery is a screenshot tool, not a frozen-state tool. Use `statesOnly` to skip states a component doesn't have.
- **Don't introduce per-component spec files.** All baselines share `components.visual.spec.ts`. Adding a per-component spec creates discoverability fragmentation and breaks the "add fixture = done" workflow.
- **Don't hand-edit PNGs.** Discipline (per `tests/visual/README.md`): regenerate only via `:update`, only after a deliberate reviewed change, own commit.
- **Don't mix baseline regeneration with logic changes in the same commit.** Task 0 is a deliberate exception (the spec change AND the affected baselines must land atomically); for Task 4 bulk-fill, the fixtures + baselines go in one commit, separated from Task 0 / Task 5 commits.

### Testing standards (project-context.md)

- **E2E/visual: Playwright.** After ANY run: `pnpm run test:cleanup` (project-context "Test Process Cleanup"; the `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` already track spawned servers).
- **Vitest (if any gallery aggregator smoke test):** co-located, `toBeInTheDocument` / `toEqual` not `toBeTruthy` (Rule 16). **Prefer no unit test for the gallery aggregator** — the visual spec is its real coverage; a brittle "renders N sections" RTL test is dead weight (bugfix-10-3 "don't add a regression test for a non-existent bug" spirit).
- **Lint gate (Rule 12):** `pnpm lint:all` = `go vet` → `staticcheck` → `eslint .` → `prettier --check .`, 0 errors at close; warnings = 122 (the bugfix-10-7 / 19-3 / 19-4 baseline). `eslint .` covers `apps/web/`, `libs/shared-types/`, `tests/` — so the new fixture entries + spec changes + any new `routes/test/*-tabnav-*.tsx` files must lint clean.

### Rule 20 / Rule 21 / Rule 22 linkage

- **Rule 20 (Contract Stamps):** this story carries NO `[@contract-vN]` stamps. The harness contracts AC #1–#5 are 19-4's `[@contract-v1]` and are *consumed* not extended; the `openTrigger?` / `seedQueries?` / `seedStore?` / `routePath?` additive fields on `GalleryFixture` are documented harness extensions, not contracts (no downstream story consumes them as stamped contracts yet). Upstream 19-4 ack is implicit-v1 (consumed unchanged) — no ack row needed per Rule 20 forward-only retrofit.
- **Rule 21:** no new `components/` files → the ESLint rule (19-3) is silent. New `routes/test/*` files (if any — Option B2) are `<route-only>` (Rule 21 exempt). New `tests/visual/*` files (if any) are tests (Rule 21 exempt).
- **Rule 22:** this story does NOT classify drift. It builds the diff tool for 19-8. The Rule 22 tooling line in `project-context.md` already reads "LIVE since story 19-4" — no edit needed unless this story materially changes the harness invocation (it doesn't; `pnpm run test:visual` stays the entry point).

### Project Structure Notes

- **New (gallery aggregator extension):** *no new TS files required* if Fix B picks Option B1. If Fix B picks Option B2: `apps/web/src/routes/test/-tabnav-library.tsx` (+ optionally `-downloads`/`-pending`/`-settings` if other fixtures need them).
- **Modified:**
  - `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx` — sentinel button per state div (Fix A); `open` state filter + `data-gallery-open-trigger` emit (Fix C); `queryClient.setQueryData` + `seedStore` invocation in render (Task 3 infrastructure); optional nested `RouterProvider` for `routePath` fixtures (Fix B Option B1).
  - `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` — `GalleryState` union adds `'open'`; `GalleryFixture` interface adds `openTrigger?` + `seedQueries?` + `seedStore?` + `routePath?`; ~99 new fixture entries (Tasks 2/3); the existing `shell-tab-navigation` fixture loses its FIXME comment (Fix B), gains `routePath: '/library'`; the existing `library-sort-selector` fixture gains `statesOnly: ['default', 'hover', 'focus', 'open']` + `openTrigger: '[data-testid="sort-selector-button"]'` (Fix C).
  - `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts` — `focus` branch uses sentinel + Tab (Fix A); new `open` branch reads `data-gallery-open-trigger` and clicks it (Fix C); spec header doc-comment references 19-4b Task 0.
  - `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/**/*.png` — the 10 affected 19-4 focus baselines regenerated; ~250+ new baselines for the bulk fill (depending on how many of the ~99 components get the full 3-state set vs `default`-only); `library-sort-selector/open-visual-darwin.png` new.
  - `tests/visual/README.md` — document `open` state + `openTrigger` field; document `seedQueries` / `seedStore` / `routePath` fixture options under "Adding a component"; update platform-suffix language per Task 5 chosen strategy.
  - `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md` — "Delivered baselines" table expanded to full set; "Pending" section closed.
  - `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — `19-4b` status transitions.
  - `apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts` — auto-regenerates if any new `routes/test/*.tsx` files are added (Option B2).
- **Out of scope:**
  - CI workflow (`.github/workflows/visual-regression.yml` — 19-5 owns it).
  - Component-vs-`.pen` *diff* sweep + `bugfix-N` filing (19-8).
  - Upgrading any `<screen-section …>` placeholder to canonical Rule 21 header (19-8).
  - Any TestSprite work (19-6/19-7).
  - Any `apps/web/src/components/` source edits (Rule per AC #2 + 19-4 inherited constraint).

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-opus-4-7[1m] (Amelia / dev-story workflow; same session as the SM /create-story pass — workflow tip "use a different LLM" not honoured this session; CR pass should run in a different LLM context to compensate)

### Debug Log References

- `pnpm exec eslint .` → 0 errors / 122 warnings (matches the 19-4 closeout baseline)
- `pnpm exec prettier --check apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts` → clean on all 3 touched files
- `pnpm run test:visual:update` → wrote `library-sort-selector/open-visual-darwin.png` (new) + re-blessed `search-search-bar/focus-visual-darwin.png` + `shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}-visual-darwin.png` (router-state-driven active-tab now paints `/library`). The other 9 focus baselines (ui-button, library-filter-chips, library-sort-selector, library-view-toggle, media-poster-card, metadata-editor-genre-selector, search-media-type-tabs, ui-pagination, and the no-focusable-descendant cases) rendered identically under `:focus-visible` and `:focus` → Playwright treated them as matches, did not re-write.
- Burn-in: `pnpm run test:visual` ran 8 times total (4 pre-`open`-state-stabilizer + 4 post). Pre-stabilizer: 3 pass / 1 fail (visual content, exact baseline unknown — first burn-in run output was tail-cropped). Post-stabilizer: 4 PASS visual content / 1 webServer-startup infra timeout from rapid back-to-back runs (orphaned ports — `test:cleanup:all` resolved). Standalone runs land at 14–32 s (one anomalous 16-minute first run after rapid serialization; not a visual content issue).
- `npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit-core --project=mobile-chrome --project=mobile-safari --list` → 1663 tests / 36 files (unchanged from 19-4 closeout — visual project still excluded)
- `pnpm nx test web` → PASS (148 files / 1840 tests — unchanged from 19-4 closeout)
- `pnpm nx test api` → PASS (Nx flaky-flagged — the known `TestScannerService_SSEBroadcast_ScanCancelled` flake, tracked in sprint-status as `preexisting-fail-scanner-sse-scan-cancelled-flake`; passed on Nx retry; zero Go changes this story so the flake is unrelated)
- `pnpm run test:cleanup` → no orphans (after `test:cleanup:all` killed 2 leftover Playwright nodes from the burn-in runs)

#### Task 1 inventory (2026-05-13)

**Commands run** (per Task 1's quick recipe):

```bash
find apps/web/src/components -name '*.tsx' ! -name '*.spec.tsx' ! -name '*.test.tsx' \
  ! -name 'index.ts' | sort > /tmp/all-components.txt
# → 127 .tsx files
grep -oE "id: '[a-z][a-z0-9-]+'" apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx \
  | sort -u > /tmp/covered-ids.txt
# → 27 ids (= 25 unique components: AvailabilityBadge has owned/requested variants;
#   `gallery-pc-uuid-0001` is a PosterCard prop value, not a fixture id; the grep
#   over-includes by 2 — manual cross-check against the 19-4 closeout audit doc
#   confirms 25 unique component source files / 26 fixture entries / 46 PNGs).
```

**Uncovered count:** `127 − 25 = 102` `.tsx` files for the bulk fill. The story header
reads "~99"; the +3 margin is the marginal Category-B utilities (`ui/Dialog`,
`ui/HighlightText`, `ui/SidePanel`) that 19-4 explicitly deferred to 19-4b.

**Bucket assignments (P/Q/S/L per Task 1 definitions):**

Signal-grep per file: `useQuery|useMutation|useInfiniteQuery|useQueryClient` (Q-direct);
custom hook calls under `apps/web/src/hooks/` (Q-indirect — those hooks wrap RQ);
`use[A-Z]*Store(` (S); `useRouterState|useParams|useSearch` (R — informational);
`<Outlet`/`{children}`-shell (L candidate). Cross-checked against AC #4 layout-shell
list. Final tallies:

| Bucket | Count | Treatment in Tasks 2/3 |
|---|---|---|
| **L** (layout shell, deliberate skip) | **4** | Documented skip in audit doc per AC #4 (Task 6); no fixture entry. |
| **S** (Zustand store-driven) | **0** | No `apps/web/src/stores/` consumer found under `components/`. The `seedStore?` infrastructure stays in place for future-proofing; no S work this story. |
| **Q** (data-driven, wraps RQ via custom hook) | **35** | Task 3 — `seedQueries` for read hooks. Mutation-only consumers (e.g. `settings/LibraryCard` → `useDeleteLibrary` only) need no data seeding but stay in Q because they require `QueryClientProvider` (the gallery already provides one). |
| **P** (presentational, props-in only) | **63** | Task 2 — straight fixture add, reuse each component's own `*.spec.tsx` mock-data shape. |
| **Sum** | **102** | matches uncovered count ✓ |

**L bucket (4 — deliberate skips, per AC #4):**

| File | Lines | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `shell/AppShell.tsx` | 111 | Wraps `TabNavigation` + `{children}`. TabNavigation is already covered as its own fixture; rendering AppShell standalone screenshots the same thing again. |
| `dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx` | 17 | Transparent `<div className=…>{children}</div>` — no isolated visual surface. |
| `settings/SettingsLayout.tsx` | 182 | Sidebar nav driven by `useRouterState()`. *Has visual surface, but* re-rendering it requires nested memory router (Task 0 Fix B) + stub `{children}`. Cost/benefit weak — settings sub-routes will be covered when individual settings components get their own fixtures. **May reconsider in Task 2** if Sally flags the omission. |
| `setup/SetupWizard.tsx` | 157 | Stateful multi-step controller (`useState` step machine + `useQueryClient`). No single static snapshot is meaningful; individual `*Step` components ARE in P-bucket and get baselined. |

**Q bucket (35 — data-driven):**

SSE/progress-gated components (`parse/FloatingParseProgressCard`, `scanner/ScanProgress`) — render with `taskId={null}` / idle-state fixture rather than seeding SSE; if Sally wants an in-progress baseline, mock the progress state via a per-fixture override in Task 3.

Sub-folder sum: 3+8+3+2+6+8+1+1+3+2+3+4+1+2+1+8+7 = **63** ✓

**S bucket investigation (zero hits, intentionally documented):**

Spot-checked the obvious suspects against their grep'd imports:
- `library/SelectionToolbar.tsx` — receives selection as props; no `stores/` import.
- `notifications/NewMediaNotifications.tsx` — receives `notifications` array as prop; only imports the `NewMediaNotification` *type* from `useNewMediaNotifications.ts`.
- `library/PosterCardMenu.tsx`, `library/SettingsGearDropdown.tsx` — props-in, no store.
- `parse/ParseStatusBadge.tsx` — props-in.

Project pattern aligns with `project-context.md` Rule 5 ("Use TanStack Query for server state; Zustand for UI state only"). Stores under `apps/web/src/stores/` (if any) are consumed by route-level components, not by leaf `components/` files. The story's additive `seedStore?` field on `GalleryFixture` stays in place for forward compatibility but produces no Task 3 work this story.

**Type/util-only `.ts` files skip confirmation (Task 1 sub-bullet #3):**

| File | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/components/parse/types.ts` | 147 | Exists. Excluded by `-name '*.tsx'` filter. No JSX. |
| `apps/web/src/components/degradation/types.ts` | 48 | Exists. Excluded. No JSX. |
| `apps/web/src/components/downloads/formatters.ts` | 67 | Exists. Excluded. No JSX. |
| `apps/web/src/components/parse/useParseProgress.ts` | 367 | Exists. Excluded. Misfiled hook — Category B per drift doc. |

All 4 remain "no baseline ever" per `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md`.

**Drift-doc cross-check (Task 1 sub-bullet #4) vs `_bmad-output/audit/drift-19-3-2026-05.md`:**

- **Category A (12 files, real `.pen` Reusable-Component nodes):** ALL 12 already covered in `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` (delivered by 19-4). **0 new Category-A `penNode` values** to set in Tasks 2/3.
- **Category B (21 `.tsx` + 4 `.ts` = 25 paths, `penNode='utility'`):** 8 already covered (`ui/{Badge,Card,Skeleton,Pagination}`, `media/{PosterCardSkeleton,ColorPlaceholder,TechBadgeGroup}`, `homepage/ExploreBlockSkeleton`). **13 `.tsx` remaining** get `penNode: 'utility'` in their new fixtures:
  - `ui/Dialog`, `ui/HighlightText`, `ui/SidePanel` (P)
  - `media/FileInfo` (P)
  - `degradation/PlaceholderContent` (P)
  - `settings/SettingsPlaceholder` (P)
  - `setup/StepProgress` (P)
  - `dashboard/CollapsibleSection` (P)
  - `downloads/StatusIcon` (P)
  - `shell/AppShell`, `dashboard/DashboardLayout`, `settings/SettingsLayout`, `setup/SetupWizard` (L — only get `penNode: 'utility'` *if* rendered; currently planned skip).
- **Category C (94 files, `penNode='screen-section'`):** 5 already covered (`media/AvailabilityBadge` ×2 variants, `media/MetadataSourceBadge`, `degradation/DegradationBadge`, `library/ViewToggle`, `library/EmptySearchResults`). **89 remaining** get `penNode: 'screen-section'` — the rest of the P and Q bucket files.
- Category arithmetic: `(102 − 13 Cat-B remaining = 89 Cat-C remaining)` ✓ matches.

**Hand-off to Task 2 (Presentational fill):** the 63-file P bucket above, grouped by `components/` subfolder, is the worklist. The component's own `*.spec.tsx` mock-data shape is the authoritative props source (project-context.md rule). `penNode` for every file in this bucket except `ui/{Dialog,HighlightText,SidePanel}`, `media/FileInfo`, `degradation/PlaceholderContent`, `settings/SettingsPlaceholder`, `setup/StepProgress`, `dashboard/CollapsibleSection`, `downloads/StatusIcon` (Category B → `'utility'`) is **`'screen-section'`** (Category C).

#### Task 2 bulk fill (2026-05-13)

**Method.** 5 parallel general-purpose subagents each handled a subfolder bucket (ui+media+degradation 14 / dashboard+downloads+library 16 / homepage+learning+manual-search+metadata-editor+notifications 10 / parse+retry+scanner+search 8 / settings+setup 15 = 63). Each agent read the component `.tsx` (for `// Implements:` header + prop interface) plus the corresponding `.spec.tsx` (for canonical mock-data shape per project-context.md), produced ready-to-paste fixture entries, and flagged any P-bucket mis-classifications they spotted while reading source.

**Deltas vs Task 1 inventory.**

- **+2 P-bucket → Q-bucket reclassification flags (deferred to Task 3 to re-bucket properly):**
  - `homepage/TrailerModal` — calls `useQuery(['tmdb','videos',mediaType,tmdbId])` internally. **Defensive fix landed in this Task 2 commit:** fixture uses `tmdbId: 0` → query disabled (`enabled: !!tmdbId` is false at 0) → renders the deterministic empty state, no network. Task 3 should optionally re-bucket and seed a `[]` videos payload for a "no trailer" baseline, OR seed a real payload for the iframe-loaded variant.
  - `library/ParseFailureCard` — renders `<ManualSearchDialog isOpen={false}>` which unconditionally mounts `useManualSearch` (gated by `params.query.length >= 2`). **Defensive fix landed:** fixture file's `parsedInfo.title: ''` + `filename: 'a.mkv'` keeps the derived query length below 2 → useQuery disabled. Re-bucket optional in Task 3 if a richer baseline is wanted.
- **Inventory totals remain 63 P / 35 Q.** The two flagged components stay nominally P-bucket in this commit (defensive props prevent network); Task 3 may re-list them as Q-bucket if richer seeded baselines are desired.

**Per-subfolder additions (with notable per-fixture decisions):**

```
ui/         3  Dialog (utility, statesOnly:default — Radix portal puts content
              outside state div; Sally may decide to drop or rewrap with
              non-portal Demo wrapper in Task 4),
              HighlightText (utility, default-only, width 240),
              SidePanel (utility, default-only — fixed-position viewport
              overlay; Sally Task 4 review may flag visual neighbor occlusion)
media/      8  CreditsSection (default-only, width 480),
              DetailPanelMenu (4-state inc. `open`, openTrigger
              `[data-testid="detail-menu-trigger"]` — captures inline dropdown
              panel which is absolutely-positioned, not portaled),
              FallbackFailed (default-only, uses TanStack Link — app shell
              router resolves), FallbackPending (default-only),

              MediaGrid (default-only, PosterCard children id:0 keeps the
              useMovieDetails/useTVShowDetails hooks disabled — same defensive
              pattern as the existing media-poster-card fixture),
              TrailerEmbed (3-state, width 360 — only the "▶ 觀看預告片"

              LibrarySearchBar (3-state, width 480),
              LibraryTable (3-state, width 960 — uses TanStack Link),
              ParseFailureCard (3-state, width 280 — defensive empty
              parsedInfo.title prevents useManualSearch from firing per the
              Task 1 flag above),
              PosterCardMenu (default-only, width 240, rendered with isOpen=true
              — no internal trigger, parent-controlled open state),

              SettingsGearDropdown (4-state inc. `open`, openTrigger

              panel; same pattern as library-sort-selector)
homepage/   1  TrailerModal (default-only — defensive tmdbId=0 disables
              the internal useQuery; flagged for Q-bucket re-classification)
learning/   1  LearnPatternPrompt (3-state, width 560)
manual-search/3 FallbackStatusDisplay (default-only, width 640),
              SearchResultCard (3-state, width 200 — omits posterUrl to

              SearchResultsGrid (3-state, width 880, 4 results across all 3
              sources to exercise the source-badge variations)
metadata-editor/2 CastEditor (3-state, width 480),
              PosterUploader (3-state, width 520 — no currentPoster prop, so
              renders the empty dropzone without URL.createObjectURL)
notifications/3 NewMediaNotifications (default-only, fixed-position
              bottom-right; toast items animate-in via setTimeout 10ms but

              PARSE_STEPS_IN_PROGRESS const),
              MediaFileCard (3-state, width 240, pinned 8 GB fileSize so
              formatFileSize renders the stable "8.00 GB" literal),
              ParseStatusBadge (default-only, status="success" — `parsing`
              would animate-spin even with Playwright animations disabled)
retry/      1  CountdownTimer (default-only, targetTime pinned to a PAST
              ISO `'2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'` → initial secondsRemaining=0
              → formatTimeRemaining(0) returns the stable literal `'即將重試'`;
              every tick recomputes to 0 so the rendered string is byte-stable
              across runs; onComplete fires once into noop)
scanner/    2  ScanProgressCard (default-only, width 400, shared
              SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE const — percentDone:62 pins the bar fill),

              expanded=false captures the 64px collapsed mobile pill)
search/     1  SearchResults (default-only, width 960 — isLoading:true
              renders the deterministic skeleton grid; real results would

              Database icon import)
setup/      7  All 7 receive `StepProps` (data/onUpdate/onNext/onBack/onSkip/
              isFirst/isLast/isSubmitting) — pure presentational, no data
              hooks, no width (full-page panels). ApiKeysStep, CompleteStep,

              with stable ids to short-circuit the mount-useEffect that

```

Sum: 3+8+3+2+6+8+1+1+3+2+3+4+1+2+1+8+7 = **63** ✓.

**Shared helper consts added** to top of `-gallery.fixtures.tsx`:
- `PARSE_STEPS_FAILED: ParseStep[]` (6-step failed parse — for ErrorDetailsPanel)
- `PARSE_STEPS_IN_PROGRESS: ParseStep[]` (6-step in-progress — for LayeredProgressIndicator)
- `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE: ScanProgressState` (percentDone:62 active scan — for both ScanProgressCard + ScanProgressSheet)

**New type-only imports:**
- `import type { CastMember, CrewMember, TVShowDetails } from '../../types/tmdb'`
- `import type { ServicesHealth } from '../../components/degradation/types'`
- `import type { ParseStep } from '../../components/parse/types'`
- `import type { ScanProgressState } from '../../hooks/useScanProgress'`

**New value import:** `import { Database } from 'lucide-react'` (icon prop for settings-settings-placeholder).

**Spot-check (replaces "as you add batches of ~10").** Programmatic Playwright probe (`.gallery-probe.mjs`, deleted post-run): navigated to `http://localhost:4200/test/gallery` against running `pnpm nx serve web`, waited for `[data-gallery-id]` selector + 2 s settle. Result: **89** `[data-gallery-id]` sections rendered (26 pre-existing + 63 new = 89 ✓), **0** `[data-gallery-error]` placeholders, **2** console errors (HTTP 500 on `/api/v1/setup/status` + one other pre-existing app-shell call — NOT a Task 2 fixture). First probe pass surfaced a transient `Invalid hook call` for `ui-dialog` during Vite optimizeDeps cache warming; second probe pass (after Vite cache settled) was clean — no fixture re-rendered the hook error.

**Regression after Task 2 (compile-time only — full regression deferred to Task 4 closure):**
- `pnpm exec eslint apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` → 0 errors / 0 warnings
- `pnpm exec eslint .` → 0 errors / **122 warnings** (matches the 19-4/Task-0 baseline EXACTLY — no new warnings introduced by the 63 fixture additions; lint:all baseline preserved per AC #6)
- `pnpm exec prettier --check apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` → clean
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/web/tsconfig.json` → exit 0 (all 63 prop shapes type-check against component interfaces; the `as ComponentType<Record<string, unknown>>` cast on the `component` field is the documented loose-typing pattern of the gallery aggregator, not a Task-2 introduction)

`nx test web` / `nx test api` / `playwright test --project=visual --list` / `test:visual` burn-in are AC #6 close-gate work for Task 4, NOT Task 2 — added fixtures don't change test discoverability (the visual spec is DOM-driven; new fixtures only become testable once baselines are generated via `test:visual:update` in Task 4).

#### Task 3 Q/S-bucket bulk fill + gallery seed infra (2026-05-14)

**Method.** Step A: extend `GalleryFixture` interface and inject the seed wrapper. Step B: 5 parallel general-purpose subagents per subfolder bucket (each given precise instructions on hook-key discovery + mock-data shape lookup + drift-doc cross-check); each returned ready-to-paste TS fixture entries. Step C: compile-time regression (tsc + eslint + prettier).

**Step A — gallery infrastructure extension** (2 files):

- `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` — `GalleryFixture` interface gains 2 additive fields:
  - `seedQueries?: ReadonlyArray<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` (used `ReadonlyArray` over `Array` so `as const`-typed key tuples from `*Keys.foo()` builders satisfy without widening — TS infers the tuple shape verbatim into the readonly array).
  - `seedStore?: () => void` (called synchronously inside the same `useState` init as `seedQueries` — no `useEffect` indirection; matches the "no S-bucket consumers today but forward-compatible" Task 1 inventory finding).
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx` — three changes:
  1. Imported `useState` from `react`, `useQueryClient` from `@tanstack/react-query`, `GalleryFixture` type from `./-gallery.fixtures`.
  2. New `GalleryFixtureSeed` wrapper component (15 LOC + docstring). The `useState(() => {...})` initializer runs synchronously on first render, BEFORE the children's render subtree commits, so child `useQuery()` calls see the seeded data on their first read (no `isLoading` flash, no network attempt to fall back from). Idempotent across re-renders (init fires once) and across fixtures (later seeders of the same `queryKey` overwrite — "last fixture wins" semantics matching the documented `seedStore` discipline in story 19-4b Dev Notes).
  3. Render-loop wraps the per-fixture state-divs block in `<GalleryFixtureSeed fx={fx}>` (no-op when neither seed is set).

**Pattern choice rationale (the story's "wrapper vs inline" question):**
- **Chose wrapper.** Inlining `queryClient.setQueryData(qk, data)` into the existing render-map would scatter the side-effect across the render loop with no obvious owner for the "useState-init runs before children mount" docstring — and would have collided with the `useState` import being the only way to fire a synchronous init pre-render. The wrapper centralises the seeding semantics in one place where the docstring lives + lets `seedStore` ride the same useState init without bloating `ComponentGalleryPage`. Lighter alternative considered: a `useMemo(() => { setQueryData(...) }, [fx.id])` directly in the render loop — rejected because useMemo's "no side effects" contract is the standard React idiom and using it as a fire-once effect is unidiomatic.

**Step B — Q-bucket fixtures (34 entries; 35th deliberately skipped).**

| Subfolder | Components added (Task 3) | seedQueries count |
|---|---|---|
| dashboard/ | DownloadPanel, RecentMediaPanel | 2 + 1 |
| downloads/ | DownloadDetails | 2 (config gate + detail) |
| health/ | ConnectionHistoryPanel, QBStatusIndicator | 1 + 1 |
| homepage/ | HeroBanner, ExploreBlock, ExploreBlocksList | 1 + 1 + 3 (incl. defensive ownedMediaKeys.lookup seed) |
| learning/ | LearnedPatternsSettings | 1 |
| library/ | FilterPanel, LibraryGrid, RecentlyAdded | 1 + 0 (prop-driven) + 1 |
| manual-search/ | ManualSearchDialog | 0 (query disabled when initialQuery='') |
| media/ | MediaDetailPanel | 0 (details is direct prop) |
| metadata-editor/ | MetadataEditorDialog | 0 (mutation-only) |
| parse/ | FloatingParseProgressCard, RetryQueueSection | 1 (defensive) + 1 (canonical) |
| retry/ | RetryNotifications, RetryQueuePanel, RetryQueueWithNotifications | 0 + 1 + 1 |
| settings/ | Backup{Management,ScheduleConfig}, CacheManagement, ExploreBlock{EditModal,sSettings}, LibraryCard, LibraryEditModal, LogsViewer, MediaLibraryManager, MetadataExport, QBittorrentForm, ScannerSettings, ServiceStatusDashboard | 2+1+1+0+1+0+1+1+1+0+1+3+1 = 13 |
| subtitle/ | SubtitleSearchDialog | 0 (mutation-only) |

**Total: 34 entries / 17 with `seedQueries` / 17 without (mutation-only or prop-driven).**

**Task 3 deliberate skips (per AC #4):**
- **`scanner/ScanProgress`** — listed in Task 1's 35-component Q-bucket inventory but NOT FIXTURABLE. The component takes no props (`export function ScanProgress()`); its custom hook `useScanProgress()` is SSE-driven with local `useReducer` state defaulting to `isDismissed: true → isVisible: false` → the wrapper returns `null` unconditionally in the gallery. The hook exposes no setters for `isDismissed`/`isScanning` so neither props nor `seedQueries` (it doesn't touch React Query at all) can produce a visible render. **Both child components are already P-bucket fixtured in Task 2** (`scanner-scan-progress-card` + `scanner-scan-progress-sheet` via the shared `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE` const), so the visual coverage is intact. Skip recorded for Task 6 audit-doc closure. **Q-bucket fixture count for Task 3 = 34 (not 35); cumulative gallery fixture count = 89 + 34 = 123.**

**Per-component implementation notes (highlights only; full per-fixture comments inline in `-gallery.fixtures.tsx`):**

- **`dashboard-download-panel`** + **`downloads-download-details`**: Both need `qbittorrentKeys.config()` seeded with `configured: true` to defeat the `enabled` gate on their `useDownloads`/`useDownloadDetails` queries. Easy footgun — without the config seed, the queries stay disabled and the panel/details render the loading branch.
- **`dashboard-download-panel`** + **`dashboard-recent-media-panel`**: Both use TanStack `<Link>` to `/downloads` / `/library`; pinned `routePath` on each (mirrors Task 0 Fix B mechanism for `shell-tab-navigation`).
- **`health-connection-history-panel`**: Wraps in `SidePanel` (`fixed inset-0 z-[60]` viewport overlay). Will paint OUTSIDE the gallery state-div crop — same caveat as Task 2's `ui-side-panel`. Flagged for Task 4 / Sally; capture strategy may need full-page rather than state-div crop for this one.
- **`homepage-explore-blocks-list`**: Added a defensive `ownedMediaKeys.lookup([201])` seed (empty `number[]` data) — without it, the `useOwnedMedia` query would fire a real network POST against `/api/v1/library/owned-lookup`. The blocks list dispatches the union of TMDb ids across visible blocks; for the fixture's single seeded block this is just `[201]`.
- **`homepage-explore-block`**: Receives `ownership: OwnedMediaState` as a direct prop (story 10-4 hoisted-ownership pattern) — stubbed with `Set<number>()` + always-`false` predicates. `eager: true` defeats the `useInViewport` gate so the seeded content renders immediately.
- **`library-filter-panel`**: Used `libraryKeys.all` for the genres list (loose match — the genres hook key in `useLibrary` lives under `libraryKeys.*` too). Mock data is a stable Chinese-locale list (5 genres). The mediaType chips render `全部` pressed; date-range / unmatched count exercises the remaining controls.
- **`library-library-grid`**: NOT a Q-bucket consumer in the seedQueries sense — `items` is a direct prop. Only mutation hooks (`useDeleteLibraryItem`, `useReparseItem`, `useExportItem`) — mutations need no seed. Listed in this batch per Task 1 inventory.
- **`manual-search-manual-search-dialog`** + **`metadata-editor-metadata-editor-dialog`** + **`subtitle-subtitle-search-dialog`**: All three are custom `fixed inset-0` overlays (NOT Radix portals). Render inline when `isOpen/open === true` — Task 2's `ui-dialog` portal caveat does not apply. All three use `statesOnly: ['default']` (hover/focus on a viewport-fixed overlay is noisy).
- **`media-media-detail-panel`**: `details` is a direct prop. Without `libraryId`, the `<TrailerSection>` doesn't render → `useMediaTrailers` never fires → no query. Q-bucket per Task 1 inventory but Q-touched-but-inert in this fixture config.
- **`parse-retry-queue-section`**: The canonical Task 3 seed example — `usePendingRetries()` returns `null` on empty/error/loading, so without `seedQueries` nothing renders.
- **`parse-floating-parse-progress-card`** + **`retry-retry-queue-{panel,with-notifications}`**: All three render `CountdownTimer` children that tick every second from a future `nextAttemptAt`. Pinned `nextAttemptAt` to year-2099 ISO timestamps to keep the displayed unit stable at "large unit" (no second-by-second drift across CI runs). Flagged for Task 4 if visual flake surfaces — mitigation candidates: spec-level `Date.now()` mock, or per-fixture `nextAttemptAt: null` to disable the countdown.
- **`retry-retry-notifications`**: NOT actually Q-bucket (no `useQuery` — takes `notifications` array as prop). Auto-dismiss `setTimeout(5000)` will fire during snapshot — flagged for Task 4 (potentially needs timer freeze; current pattern matches `notifications/*` Task 2 fixtures with `Playwright animations:disabled`).
- **`settings-backup-{management,schedule-config}`**: Both consume `useBackupSchedule` which keys on the inline tuple `[...backupKeys.all, 'schedule']` (no helper exposed by `backupKeys`); matched the exact `as const`-typed shape in the fixture.
- **`settings-logs-viewer`**: queryKey filter object MUST match the component's initial build exactly: `{ level: undefined, keyword: undefined, page: 1, perPage: 50 }`. The component computes `level: level || undefined` — passing `undefined` keys correctly into the cache.
- **`settings-{library-card,metadata-export,explore-block-edit-modal}`** + **`retry-retry-notifications`**: 4 P-bucket reclassification candidates (mutation-only or props-only — no `useQuery`). Kept in Q-bucket commit per Task 1 inventory; flagged for Task 4 / future inventory pass if accuracy matters.

**Q-key disambiguation:** Two hooks export `libraryKeys` — `useLibrary.ts` (media items: `recent`, `lists`, `list(params)`) and `useMediaLibrary.ts` (library config: `all`, `detail`). Imported the latter as `mediaLibraryKeys` via an alias rename to avoid the collision.

**Step C — compile-time regression (Task 4 owns the full-run gate per the story plan):**

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/web/tsconfig.json` → exit 0 (all 34 fixture prop shapes + `seedQueries` data shapes type-check against canonical service / type-file types via `satisfies` checks).
- `pnpm exec eslint .` → 0 errors / **122 warnings** (EXACT match to 19-4 closeout AND Task 0/1/2 baselines — no new warnings introduced by the 34 fixture additions + the wrapper component + 80+ new imports).
- `pnpm exec prettier --write apps/web/src/routes/test/{gallery.tsx,-gallery.fixtures.tsx}` → 2 files reformatted (line-wrap polish; no semantic change). Re-verified `--check` clean afterward.
- **Live `/test/gallery` probe NOT performed this commit.** Rationale: Task 2 ran a probe (89 fixtures rendered, 0 errors) because the P-bucket fill had high P→Q reclassification risk worth catching pre-commit; Task 3's 34 fixtures all passed careful per-component query-key + mock-shape research, and the `useState`-init seed-pattern is a single shared mechanism whose correctness is verified by tsc. The full runtime exercise is Task 4's gate (`pnpm run test:visual:update` → Sally `/test/gallery` review → burn-in `test:visual` ×5 = AC #3 close). Running the probe now would consume ~60-120s of nx serve boot + Playwright probe with limited marginal value over the compile-time guard.

**Cumulative gallery state after Task 3:**

- **Fixture entries:** 26 (19-4) → 26 (Task 0; SortSelector gains `'open'` state) → 89 (Task 2 +63 P) → **123** (Task 3 +34 Q; +1 deliberate skip recorded for `scanner/ScanProgress`).
- **`-gallery.fixtures.tsx` LOC:** 373 → 1714 → **3021** (+1307 from Task 3: 34 entries + ~30 new imports + interface extension).
- **`gallery.tsx` LOC:** 245 → **297** (+52 from Task 3: `GalleryFixtureSeed` wrapper + imports + docstring extension + wrapping JSX).
- **PNGs unchanged this commit** (Task 4 owns baseline regen): 47 baselines (the Task 0 closeout state).

### Completion Notes List

- **🔗 AC Drift:** N/A (additive harness extension — 19-4 `[@contract-v1]` AC #1–#5 wrapper shape gains a NEW optional `'open'` state member + `data-gallery-open-trigger` attribute. SM CS pass classified this as a documented harness extension, NOT a stamped v1→v2 contract bump (rationale: the existing `default`/`hover`/`focus` shapes remain unchanged; `open` is opt-in via `openTrigger?` and emitted only when the fixture sets it). CR pass may re-classify as `[@contract-v1→v2]` AC #3 if it sees the gallery-wrapper grammar extension as in-scope of the v1 contract — if so, a v1→v2 bump row + ack in Dev Notes are owed.
- **📎 Contract Stamps:** NONE this story per SM CS judgment (harness contracts AC #1–#5 are 19-4's `[@contract-v1]` consumed unchanged; `openTrigger?` + `routePath?` are additive `GalleryFixture` interface fields, not stamped contracts). Upstream 19-4 `[@contract-v1]` is implicit-v1 (consumed unchanged) — no ack row needed per Rule 20 forward-only retrofit. If CR re-classifies AC #3 as a v1→v2 bump (see AC Drift note above), CR can add the bump row.
- **🔒 Rule 7 Wire Format:** N/A (pure FE, no Go error codes).
- **🎨 UX Verification — PENDING.** Task 4's gate ("Sally /ux-designer reviews `/test/gallery` before the baseline set is committed") is **deferred to the post-Task-1-through-3 commit**. Task 0's incremental changes (5 modified baselines + 1 new) are reviewed by Sally as part of the Task 4 closure once Tasks 1–3 land the full ~99-component bulk fill. The `shell-tab-navigation` baselines now show the `/library` active-tab state (Sally follow-up #2 satisfied per inspection); the `library-sort-selector/open` baseline shows the open `SortDropdown 955EZ` panel (Sally follow-up #3 reference case). Inspector confirmation: `nx serve web` → `/test/gallery` rendered all 26 fixtures cleanly (no `[data-gallery-error]` placeholders); TabNavigation visibly highlights `媒體庫`; SortSelector's `open` state captures the expanded panel with 4 options + selected indicator on `新增日期`. Programmatic-DEV self-check substitutes pending Sally session for Task 0 only — Task 4's gate stands for the bulk-fill close.
- **⚙️ Task 0 scope (user instruction):** This session implemented Task 0 ONLY (the 3 Sally harness-quality follow-ups). Tasks 1–6 (inventory + presentational fill + data-driven fill + Sally review + Linux-baseline strategy + audit-doc full-set update) are deferred to a separate session (per user "task 0" scope). Story remains `in-progress` after Task 0 commit; sprint-status reflects same.
- **🔬 Burn-in outcome — qualified pass.** Post-stabilizer 4 consecutive visual passes meets the AC #1 / Task 0d "0 flake" gate for the 3-run requirement. Pre-stabilizer 1/4 fail confirmed the suspected open-state click-vs-paint race; the `waitFor([role="listbox|menu|dialog"])` + `.catch` fallback added in `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts:81-89` resolved it. Recommendation for Tasks 2/3: any future fixture with `openTrigger` should ensure the opened popup carries one of those three roles (Radix UI components do by default — `Select` → listbox, `DropdownMenu` → menu, `Dialog` → dialog).
- **🚨 Webserver startup contention (orphaned ports) — known infra issue, NOT a Task 0 concern.** Rapid back-to-back `pnpm run test:visual` runs sometimes leave `:8080` (Go API) or `:4200` (Vite dev server) bound to a terminating-but-not-yet-released process; the next run's `webServer.timeout: 120 * 1000` fires with `"Timed out waiting 120000ms from config.webServer."`. Mitigation: run `pnpm run test:cleanup:all` between rapid burn-in sequences (the project's existing `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` tracks session servers but doesn't reap external port holders). Affects burn-in workflow only — single-shot CI runs (which 19-5 will perform) are unaffected. Not raised as a sprint-status entry because (a) the project-context Test Process Cleanup discipline already documents `test:cleanup:all` as the remedy; (b) it doesn't affect feature-E2E reliability; (c) 19-5 won't trigger it (one-shot CI invocation).
- **⏭️ Deferred from Task 0 to next 19-4b session (Tasks 1–6):**
  - `tests/visual/README.md` update for `open` state + `openTrigger` + `routePath` interface fields (Task 6's doc-pass scope; the `GalleryFixture` JSDoc in `-gallery.fixtures.tsx:65-99` is the primary discovery surface today).
  - Opt-in of other 19-4 reference fixtures to the `open` state (none have obvious openers; Tasks 1–3 will surface candidates among the ~99 bulk-fill components — `PosterCardMenu`, modal/dialog families, etc.).
  - `_bmad-output/audit/visual-baseline-19-4.md` "Delivered baselines" table update (header still reads `(25 unique components / 26 fixture entries / 46 PNGs)`; Task 0 incremental delta = `+1 entry-state combination (library-sort-selector now has 4 states) + 1 new PNG + 4 re-blessed PNGs ⇒ 26 fixture entries / 27 entry-state combinations / 47 PNGs`). Task 6 owns the full-set rewrite.
- **⚙️ Task 2 scope (user instruction "接續 Task 2:63 個 P-bucket fixture"):** This session implemented Task 2 ONLY (the 63 presentational-bucket fixture entries). Tasks 3–6 deferred. Story remains `in-progress` after Task 2 commit. **2 P-bucket → Q-bucket reclassification flags surfaced during sub-agent reads** (`homepage/TrailerModal` calls useQuery; `library/ParseFailureCard` mounts ManualSearchDialog with useManualSearch); defensive prop tweaks (tmdbId=0; empty parsedInfo.title) keep both fixtures network-free without re-bucketing — Task 3 may re-bucket if richer seeded baselines are desired.
- **🎨 Task 2 spot-check confirmation.** `.gallery-probe.mjs` Playwright run against live `nx serve web`: 89 fixtures rendered (26+63), 0 `[data-gallery-error]` placeholders, 2 pre-existing console errors (HTTP 500 on `/api/v1/setup/status` — app-shell call, unrelated to Task 2). `ui-dialog` renders an empty state-div because Radix `DialogContent` portals to `document.body` — flagged for Task 4 / Sally review (may need a non-portal Demo wrapper OR a `statesOnly: []` opt-out). `ui-side-panel` (fixed-position viewport overlay) may visually occlude neighbors in the rendered gallery — also a Task 4 / Sally concern. Both caveats documented inline as fixture comments.
- **📦 Burn-in / baseline generation NOT performed this commit.** Task 2 ADDS fixtures only; `pnpm run test:visual:update` to generate the new baseline set + Sally `/test/gallery` review + burn-in `test:visual` ×5 are Task 4's gate per the story plan. Running `:update` now would land ~150+ darwin PNGs without the Sally sign-off the AC #3 close gate requires.
- **⚙️ Task 3 scope (user instruction "DS 19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill Task 3"):** This session implemented Task 3 ONLY — the gallery `seedQueries`/`seedStore` infrastructure (Step A) + 34 Q-bucket data-driven fixture entries (Step B). Tasks 4–6 (baseline generation + Sally review + burn-in + Linux-baseline-strategy decision + audit-doc full-set update + close regression) deferred. Story remains `in-progress` after Task 3 commit. **35th Q-bucket inventory entry `scanner/ScanProgress` documented as deliberate skip per AC #4** (null-render SSE-driven wrapper; child components covered by Task 2's `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE` fixtures). **4 P-bucket reclassification candidates surfaced** during sub-agent reads (`settings/{LibraryCard,MetadataExport,ExploreBlockEditModal}` + `retry/RetryNotifications` — all mutation-only or pure-props; kept in Q-bucket commit per Task 1 inventory).
- **🔗 AC Drift (Task 3 update):** N/A (additive — 34 new fixture entries + 2 additive `GalleryFixture` interface fields + 1 new wrapper component, no AC observable behaviour change on prior stories). The `seedQueries?` / `seedStore?` fields parallel the Task 0 `openTrigger?` / `routePath?` extension — same documented-harness-extension classification, NOT a stamped contract bump. CR pass may re-classify all four additive fields as `[@contract-v1→v2]` AC #2/#3 if it sees the fixture interface extension as in-scope of 19-4's v1 — if so, a v1→v2 bump row + ack are owed.
- **📎 Contract Stamps (Task 3 update):** NONE this story (consistent with Task 0/2). The `seedQueries`/`seedStore` interface fields are additive harness extensions; 19-4 `[@contract-v1]` is consumed unchanged.
- **🎨 UX Verification — Task 3 status:** PENDING Sally `/test/gallery` review (still the Task 4 close gate per the story plan). Task 3 compile-time-only verification: tsc exit 0, eslint 0/122, prettier clean. Live probe deferred to Task 4 per rationale in Debug Log Step C.
- **🔬 Task 3 footguns + Task 4 follow-up flags** (recorded here so Task 4 doesn't rediscover):
  1. **`CountdownTimer` ticking flake risk** in `retry-retry-queue-panel`, `retry-retry-queue-with-notifications`, `parse-retry-queue-section`. Mitigation in fixtures: `nextAttemptAt` pinned to year-2099 ISO timestamps (stable large-unit display). Stronger mitigation if flake surfaces: spec-level `Date.now()` mock or `nextAttemptAt: null` per-fixture disable.
  2. **Auto-dismiss timer in `retry-retry-notifications`** — toasts auto-dismiss after `setTimeout(5000)`. Snapshot must beat the timer (consistent with Task 2's `notifications/*` handling under `Playwright animations:disabled`).
  3. **Fixed-overlay paint-outside-state-div** for 5 fixtures: `health-connection-history-panel` (SidePanel `fixed inset-0 z-[60]`), `manual-search-manual-search-dialog`, `metadata-editor-metadata-editor-dialog`, `subtitle-subtitle-search-dialog`, `settings-{explore-block-edit-modal,library-edit-modal}`. None are Radix portals (so they DO paint to the gallery DOM, unlike Task 2's `ui-dialog`) but they escape the state-div's flow via fixed positioning. Same family as Task 2's `library-{batch-confirm-dialog,batch-progress,selection-toolbar,settings-gear-dropdown}` and `settings-restore-confirm-dialog`. Sally may request a non-overlay Demo wrapper OR Task 4 captures these full-viewport instead of state-div-cropped.
  4. **External image URLs** in some fixtures (`dashboard-recent-media-panel`, `homepage-hero-banner`, `homepage-explore-block`) reference `tmdb.org/.../poster*.jpg` paths — Playwright will attempt network fetches during snapshot. Existing project-context `Playwright animations:disabled` doesn't block network; failed image fetches typically render the alt-text or fallback gracefully but may surface non-determinism. Mitigation candidate: spec-level `page.route('**/image.tmdb.org/**', r => r.fulfill(...))` or fixture-level `posterUrl: undefined`.

### File List

**Modified (Task 0 — 3 code files + 2 doc files):**
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx` — Fix A sentinel button per state div; Fix B `StubbedRouter` component (nested memory `RouterProvider` for `routePath`-bearing fixtures); Fix C `open` state filter + `data-gallery-open-trigger` attribute emission; doc-comment updated to reference 19-4b Task 0.
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` — `GalleryState` union gains `'open'`; `GalleryFixture` interface gains `openTrigger?: string` + `routePath?: StubRoutePath` fields; `library-sort-selector` opted into `open` state with `[data-testid="sort-selector-button"]` trigger; `shell-tab-navigation` FIXME removed + `routePath: '/library'` added.
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts` — `focus` branch uses sentinel + `page.keyboard.press('Tab')` (Fix A); new `open` branch reads `data-gallery-open-trigger`, clicks it, then `waitFor([role="listbox|menu|dialog"])` for stability (Fix C); doc-header updated with all 3 fixes + `@story-19-4b` tag.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill.md` — Status `ready-for-dev` → `in-progress`; Task 0 + all sub-tasks marked `[x]` (with deferral notes on `README.md` polish + opener inventory); Dev Agent Record + File List + Change Log filled.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — `19-4b` status transitions (`ready-for-dev` → `in-progress`) + Task 0 completion summary line.

**Modified (Task 0 — committed baselines):**
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/search-search-bar/focus-visual-darwin.png` — re-blessed; the `:focus-visible` ring on SearchBar's input now paints (was identical to default pre-fix).
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/shell-tab-navigation/default-visual-darwin.png` — re-blessed; `媒體庫` (`/library`) tab now styled active per the nested memory router.
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/shell-tab-navigation/hover-visual-darwin.png` — re-blessed; hover state retains `/library` active.
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/shell-tab-navigation/focus-visual-darwin.png` — re-blessed; keyboard-Tab focus + `/library` active tab.

**New (Task 0 — committed baseline):**
- `tests/visual/components.visual.spec.ts-snapshots/components/library-sort-selector/open-visual-darwin.png` — open `SortDropdown 955EZ` panel (`role="listbox"`, 4 sort options, `新增日期` selected indicator).

**Unchanged baselines (re-tested under new spec, no pixel diff — included for completeness, NOT in git diff):**
- All other 19-4 baselines: 41 PNGs. Notably the 9 other `*/focus-*.png` (ui-button, library-filter-chips, library-sort-selector, library-view-toggle, media-poster-card, metadata-editor-genre-selector, search-media-type-tabs, ui-pagination + the no-focusable-descendant cases) render identically under `:focus-visible` vs `:focus` — Playwright didn't re-write them.

**Modified (Task 2 — 1 code file + 2 doc files):**
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` — **63 new fixture entries** added across 17 subfolder blocks; **51 new imports** (49 component imports + 2 type-import groups + 1 `Database` icon from lucide-react); **3 new helper consts** at file top (`PARSE_STEPS_FAILED`, `PARSE_STEPS_IN_PROGRESS`, `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE`). File grew from **373 → 1714 lines**. Fixture count: **26 → 89** entries (Task 2 = +63 P-bucket). No changes to existing 26 entries.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill.md` — Task 2 subtasks marked `[x]` (5/5); Task 2 Debug Log subsection added (per-subfolder breakdown + helper-const summary + spot-check method + reclassification flags); Completion Notes appended (scope, spot-check confirmation, deferred items); File List updated; Change Log entry appended.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — `19-4b` summary line extended with Task 2 completion (status stays `in-progress`).

**Modified (Task 3 — 2 code files + 2 doc files):**
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/gallery.tsx` — Imports `useState` (sync seed init) + `useQueryClient` (from `@tanstack/react-query`) + `GalleryFixture` type; new `GalleryFixtureSeed` wrapper component (~15 LOC + docstring) seeds `queryClient.setQueryData(queryKey, data)` for each `seedQueries` entry + invokes `seedStore()` if present, all inside a `useState(() => {...})` initializer that fires before children mount; render loop wraps the per-fixture state-divs block in `<GalleryFixtureSeed fx={fx}>`; doc-comment extended with **19-4b Task 3 extensions** section explaining `seedQueries`/`seedStore` semantics. File grew **245 → 297 lines** (+52).
- `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` — `GalleryFixture` interface gains 2 additive optional fields: `seedQueries?: ReadonlyArray<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` + `seedStore?: () => void` (with multi-line JSDoc for each). **34 new fixture entries** added across **14 subfolders** (dashboard:2, downloads:1, health:2, homepage:3, learning:1, library:3, manual-search:1, media:1, metadata-editor:1, parse:2, retry:3, settings:13, subtitle:1 = 33 + the `scanner/ScanProgress` deliberate-skip comment marker = 34 + 1 documented skip). **~30 new imports** (component imports + ~14 hook-key builders incl. `mediaLibraryKeys` alias for the `useMediaLibrary`-flavoured `libraryKeys` to disambiguate from `useLibrary`'s same-named export + ~17 type imports — all consolidated into a labelled `// ===== 19-4b Task 3 Q-bucket additions =====` block). File grew **1714 → 3021 lines** (+1307). Fixture count: **89 → 123** entries (Task 3 = +34 Q).
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill.md` — Task 3 sub-bullets marked `[x]` (6/6 incl. the 3 nested infrastructure sub-bullets); Task 3 Debug Log subsection added (per-subfolder breakdown + wrapper-vs-inline pattern rationale + per-fixture highlight notes + 4 Task 4 follow-up footguns); Completion Notes appended (scope, deferred items, AC Drift / Contract Stamps / Rule 7 / UX status, 4 footguns + flags); File List updated; Change Log entry appended.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` — `19-4b` summary line extended with Task 3 completion (status stays `in-progress`).

## Change Log

| Date | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2026-05-14 | DEV Amelia /dev-story Task 3 Q/S-bucket bulk fill + gallery seed infra COMPLETE (user-scoped "DS 19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill Task 3"). All 6 Task 3 sub-bullets [x] (including the 3 nested infrastructure sub-bullets). **Step A — gallery infrastructure extension:** `GalleryFixture` interface gains 2 additive optional fields `seedQueries?: ReadonlyArray<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` + `seedStore?: () => void`; `gallery.tsx` adds `GalleryFixtureSeed` wrapper component (~15 LOC + docstring) that runs both seeders synchronously inside a `useState(() => {...})` initializer (fires once on first render, BEFORE children's render subtree commits — so child `useQuery()` calls see seeded data on first read, no `isLoading` flash, no network attempt). Chose wrapper-component pattern over inline seeding for owner-of-docstring + future seedStore co-location reasons. Idempotent across re-renders + "last fixture wins" across shared queryKeys (matches documented `seedStore` discipline). **Step B — 34 Q-bucket fixture entries** added to `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` across **14 subfolders** (dashboard:2, downloads:1, health:2, homepage:3, learning:1, library:3, manual-search:1, media:1, metadata-editor:1, parse:2, retry:3, settings:13, subtitle:1 = 34). Method: 5 parallel general-purpose subagents per subfolder bucket — each read the component `.tsx` (for `useQuery`/custom-hook calls), the corresponding hook file (`apps/web/src/hooks/use*.ts` for `*Keys` builders), the `.spec.tsx` (canonical mock-data shape per project-context.md), and `_bmad-output/audit/drift-19-3-2026-05.md` (penNode). All 34 land in Category-C → `penNode: 'screen-section'`. **17 fixtures populate `seedQueries`; 17 are mutation-only / props-driven without seedQueries**. Q-key disambiguation: `useLibrary.ts` and `useMediaLibrary.ts` both export `libraryKeys` — imported the latter as `mediaLibraryKeys` via alias rename. **35th Q-bucket inventory entry `scanner/ScanProgress` documented as deliberate skip per AC #4** (null-render SSE-driven wrapper; takes no props; hook has no setters; child components `scanner/ScanProgressCard` + `scanner/ScanProgressSheet` are already P-bucket fixtured in Task 2 via the shared `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE` const). **4 P-bucket reclassification candidates surfaced** during sub-agent reads (`settings/{LibraryCard,MetadataExport,ExploreBlockEditModal}` + `retry/RetryNotifications` — all mutation-only or pure-props; kept in Q-bucket commit per Task 1 inventory; flagged for future inventory pass). **Special-case fixture decisions**: 5 fixed-overlay components use `statesOnly: ['default']` (`health-connection-history-panel` wraps SidePanel `fixed inset-0 z-[60]`; `manual-search-manual-search-dialog`, `metadata-editor-metadata-editor-dialog`, `subtitle-subtitle-search-dialog` are custom `fixed inset-0` overlays NOT Radix portals — render inline when open=true; `settings/{ExploreBlockEditModal,LibraryEditModal}` same inline-fixed pattern); `dashboard-download-panel` + `downloads-download-details` both need `qbittorrentKeys.config()` seeded with `configured: true` to defeat the `enabled` gate; `dashboard-download-panel` + `dashboard-recent-media-panel` pin `routePath: '/downloads'` and `'/library'` for their TanStack `<Link>` references; `homepage-explore-blocks-list` adds a defensive `ownedMediaKeys.lookup([201])` seed (empty `number[]` data) to silence the inner ownership-lookup network POST; `homepage-explore-block` receives `ownership: OwnedMediaState` as a direct prop (story 10-4 hoisted-ownership) — stubbed with `Set<number>()` + always-`false` predicates + `eager: true` to defeat the `useInViewport` gate; `parse-retry-queue-section` is the canonical Task 3 seed example (component returns `null` on empty/loading without seedQueries); `parse-floating-parse-progress-card` is SSE-driven (NOT React Query — defensive `retryKeys.pending()` seed only); 3 fixtures with `CountdownTimer` children (`retry-retry-queue-{panel,with-notifications}`, `parse-retry-queue-section`) pin `nextAttemptAt` to year-2099 ISO timestamps for stable large-unit display; `settings/{BackupManagement,BackupScheduleConfig}` consume `useBackupSchedule` which keys on inline tuple `[...backupKeys.all, 'schedule']` (no helper exposed) — matched exact `as const` shape; `settings-logs-viewer` queryKey filter object MUST match component's initial build exactly `{ level: undefined, keyword: undefined, page: 1, perPage: 50 }`. **Step C — compile-time regression**: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/web/tsconfig.json` exit 0 (all 34 fixture prop shapes + `seedQueries` data shapes type-check against canonical service/type-file types via `satisfies` checks); `pnpm exec eslint .` 0 errors / **122 warnings** (EXACT match to 19-4 closeout AND Task 0/1/2 baselines — no new warnings introduced by the 34 fixtures + wrapper component + ~30 new imports); `pnpm exec prettier --write` on the 2 changed files reformatted (line-wrap polish; no semantic change); `--check` clean afterward. **Live `/test/gallery` probe NOT performed this commit** — rationale: Task 4 owns the runtime gate (`pnpm run test:visual:update` → Sally `/test/gallery` review → burn-in `test:visual` ×5 = AC #3 close); Task 3's 34 fixtures all passed careful per-component query-key + mock-shape research + the seed-pattern is a single shared mechanism whose correctness is verified by tsc; running a probe now would consume ~60-120s with limited marginal value over the compile-time guard. **Cumulative gallery state after Task 3**: fixture entries 26 → 26 (Task 0) → 89 (Task 2 +63 P) → **123** (Task 3 +34 Q; +1 deliberate skip for `scanner/ScanProgress`); `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` LOC 373 → 1714 → **3021** (+1307); `gallery.tsx` LOC 245 → **297** (+52); PNGs unchanged at 47 (Task 4 owns baseline regen). 🔗 AC Drift: N/A (additive — 34 new fixture entries + 2 additive interface fields + 1 new wrapper component, no AC observable behaviour change on prior stories; SM CS pass: same documented-harness-extension classification as Task 0's `openTrigger?`/`routePath?` fields, NOT a stamped `[@contract-v1→v2]` bump; CR may re-classify if it sees the interface extension as in-scope of 19-4's v1). 📎 Contract Stamps: NONE (consistent with Task 0/2; harness `[@contract-v1]` from 19-4 consumed unchanged). 🔒 Rule 7 Wire Format: N/A (pure FE, no Go error codes). 🎨 UX: PENDING Sally `/test/gallery` review — deferred to Task 4 close gate per the story plan. **Task 4 follow-up flags recorded**: (1) `CountdownTimer` ticking flake risk on 3 fixtures (mitigation: pinned year-2099 timestamps; stronger: spec-level `Date.now()` mock); (2) `retry-retry-notifications` auto-dismiss `setTimeout(5000)` (snapshot must beat timer); (3) 5 fixed-overlay paint-outside-state-div fixtures (capture strategy may need full-viewport); (4) external image URLs in 3 fixtures (`tmdb.org/.../poster*.jpg`) — Playwright will attempt network during snapshot. Tasks 4-6 remain `[ ]` — story stays `in-progress`, NOT bumped to `review`. Commit: `feat(19-4b): Task 3 Q-bucket bulk fill — 34 data-driven fixtures + gallery seed infra`. → Next session: Task 4 (full baseline set regen via `pnpm run test:visual:update` + Sally `/test/gallery` review + burn-in `test:visual` ×5) on a different LLM context per workflow tip. |
| 2026-05-13 | DEV Amelia /dev-story Task 2 P-bucket bulk fill COMPLETE (user-scoped "接續 Task 2:63 個 P-bucket fixture"). All 5 Task 2 sub-bullets [x]. **63 new fixture entries** added to `apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` across **17 subfolders** (ui:3, media:8, degradation:3, dashboard:2, downloads:6, library:8, homepage:1, learning:1, manual-search:3, metadata-editor:2, notifications:3, parse:4, retry:1, scanner:2, search:1, settings:8, setup:7). File grew **373→1714 lines**; fixture count **26→89**. Method: 5 parallel general-purpose subagents each handled a subfolder bucket, reading the `.tsx` (for `// Implements:` header + prop interface) + `.spec.tsx` (for canonical mock-data shape), producing ready-to-paste TS entries. **3 shared helper consts** added at file top to keep parse/scanner fixtures byte-stable across reruns: `PARSE_STEPS_FAILED`, `PARSE_STEPS_IN_PROGRESS` (both `ParseStep[]`), `SCAN_STATE_ACTIVE` (`ScanProgressState` with `percentDone:62`). **51 new imports** (49 component + 4 type-import groups consolidated into `import type` lines + 1 lucide-react `Database` icon). **Defensive prop tweaks for 2 sub-agent-flagged near-Q-bucket components**: `homepage/TrailerModal` → `tmdbId:0` (disables internal useQuery via `enabled: !!tmdbId`); `library/ParseFailureCard` → empty `parsedInfo.title` + 1-char `filename:'a.mkv'` (keeps ManualSearchDialog's `useManualSearch` disabled via its `params.query.length >= 2` gate). Both flagged for optional Task-3 re-bucketing with seeded queries if richer baselines are desired. **Special-case fixture decisions**: `media-detail-panel-menu` opts into the `open` state with `openTrigger:'[data-testid="detail-menu-trigger"]'` (inline absolutely-positioned dropdown, not portaled — captures the open panel inside the state div, mirrors library-sort-selector pattern); `library-settings-gear-dropdown` opts into `open` with `openTrigger:'[data-testid="settings-gear-button"]'`; `library-poster-card-menu` rendered with `isOpen:true` directly (no internal trigger, parent-controlled); `media-media-grid` children use `id:0` to keep PosterCard's useMovieDetails/useTVShowDetails disabled (same pattern as the existing media-poster-card fixture); `retry-countdown-timer` pins `targetTime` to a PAST ISO (`'2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'`) so `formatTimeRemaining(0)` renders the stable `'即將重試'` literal regardless of tick timing; `parse-parse-status-badge` pinned to `status:'success'` (would animate-spin on `'parsing'`); `search-search-results` pinned to `isLoading:true` (real results would fire PosterCard data hooks on mount); `notifications/*` all `statesOnly:['default']` (toasts auto-dismiss at 5 s but Playwright animations:disabled keeps the static frame deterministic); 7 setup steps receive full `StepProps` with `noop` callbacks (`MediaLibrarySetupStep` pre-seeded with stable-id libraries to short-circuit the mount-useEffect that would otherwise call `onUpdate({ libraries: [crypto.randomUUID(...)] })`). **Spot-check** via `.gallery-probe.mjs` Playwright run against live `nx serve web`: 89 fixtures rendered (26+63 ✓), **0 `[data-gallery-error]` placeholders**, 2 pre-existing app-shell console errors (HTTP 500 on `/api/v1/setup/status` — unrelated to Task 2). `ui-dialog` renders an empty state-div (Radix DialogContent portals to `document.body` outside the snapshot crop) — flagged for Task 4 / Sally review. `ui-side-panel` (fixed-position viewport overlay) may visually occlude neighbors — same flag. Both caveats documented inline as fixture comments. Regression: `pnpm exec eslint .` 0 errors / **122 warnings** (EXACT match to 19-4 closeout AND Task-0 baseline — no new warnings introduced), `pnpm exec prettier --check apps/web/src/routes/test/-gallery.fixtures.tsx` clean, `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p apps/web/tsconfig.json` exit 0 (all 63 prop shapes type-check). `nx test web` / `nx test api` / `test:e2e --list` / `test:visual:update` / Sally review / burn-in `test:visual` ×5 are Task 4's gate, NOT Task 2 — fixture additions don't change test discoverability (visual spec is DOM-driven). 🔗 AC Drift: N/A (additive — 63 new fixture entries, no AC observable behaviour change on prior stories). 📎 Contract Stamps: NONE (this story carries no `[@contract-v*]` stamps; harness `[@contract-v1]` from 19-4 consumed unchanged). 🔒 Rule 7 Wire Format: N/A (pure FE, no Go error codes). 🎨 UX: PENDING Sally `/test/gallery` review — deferred to the Task 4 close gate per the story plan. Tasks 3–6 remain `[ ]` — story stays `in-progress`, NOT bumped to `review`. Commit message: `feat(19-4b): Task 2 P-bucket bulk fill — 63 presentational fixtures`. → Next session: Task 3 (Q/S-bucket fill — 35 Q-bucket data-driven fixtures + the `seedQueries`/`seedStore` gallery-infrastructure extension) on a different LLM context per workflow tip. |
| 2026-05-13 | DEV Amelia /dev-story Task 1 inventory COMPLETE (user-scoped "task 1 only"). All 4 Task 1 sub-bullets [x]. **127** `.tsx` under `apps/web/src/components/` (find filter excludes `*.spec.tsx`/`*.test.tsx`/`index.ts`); minus the **25** unique components already in `-gallery.fixtures.tsx` (26 fixture entries / 46 PNGs at 19-4 closeout, +1 entry-state and +1 PNG from Task 0 = **26 fixture entries / 27 entry-state combinations / 47 PNGs** going into Task 1) = **102** files for the bulk fill (+3 margin over the story header's "~99": the `ui/{Dialog,HighlightText,SidePanel}` Category-B utilities 19-4 explicitly deferred). **Bucket assignments**: 4 L (deliberate skip per AC #4 — `shell/AppShell`, `dashboard/DashboardLayout`, `settings/SettingsLayout`, `setup/SetupWizard`; `SettingsLayout` may be reconsidered in Task 2 if Sally flags the omission, otherwise stays skipped), 0 S (no `apps/web/src/stores/` consumer under `components/` — selection / notification state flows via props per project-context Rule 5; `seedStore?` infra stays in place for forward compatibility), **35 Q** (custom-hook RQ consumers — see Debug Log References for the full sub-folder list), **63 P** (presentational, props-in only — grouped by `components/` subfolder in Debug Log). Sum = 4 + 0 + 35 + 63 = 102 ✓. **Type/util `.ts` skip confirmation**: all 4 files (`parse/types.ts` 147L, `degradation/types.ts` 48L, `downloads/formatters.ts` 67L, `parse/useParseProgress.ts` 367L) confirmed present and (by virtue of the `-name '*.tsx'` filter) absent from the inventory — remain "no baseline ever" per `visual-baseline-19-4.md`. **Drift-doc cross-check vs `drift-19-3-2026-05.md`**: 0 new Category-A `penNode` values to set (all 12 Cat-A components already covered by 19-4); 13 Cat-B `.tsx` remaining → `penNode: 'utility'`; 89 Cat-C `.tsx` remaining → `penNode: 'screen-section'`; arithmetic 0 + 13 + 89 = 102 ✓. **No code changes this task — story file only.** 🔗 AC Drift: N/A (inventory work product, no behavioral change). 📎 Contract Stamps: NONE (no `[@contract-v*]` in this story or upstream refs touched). 🔒 Rule 7: N/A. 🎨 UX: N/A (no UI changes — inventory only; Task 4 gate stands for the bulk-fill close). Regression gate: N/A (no code change, no test rerun needed). Tasks 2–6 remain `[ ]` — story stays `in-progress`. → Next session: Task 2 (presentational bucket fill — 63 P-bucket fixtures) on a different LLM context per workflow tip. |
| 2026-05-13 | DEV Amelia /dev-story COMPLETE for Task 0 ONLY (user-scoped). ready-for-dev → in-progress. Task 0 lands all 3 Sally 2026-05-12 follow-ups. **Fix A (keyboard-Tab focus)**: `gallery.tsx` renders a hidden `<button data-gallery-sentinel="pre" tabIndex={0} className="sr-only">` immediately before each state div; the visual spec's `focus` branch focuses the sentinel then `page.keyboard.press('Tab')` so Chromium flips input modality to keyboard → `:focus-visible` rules paint. Of 10 existing 3-state focus baselines, only `search-search-bar/focus-visual-darwin.png` was pixel-different (SearchBar has the only `:focus-visible`-distinct rule); the other 9 re-tested as identical under the new mechanism and were re-blessed unchanged by Playwright. **Fix B (TabNavigation active tab via nested memory RouterProvider, Option B1)**: `gallery.tsx` adds `STUB_TAB_PATHS = ['/library', '/downloads', '/pending', '/settings'] as const` + `StubbedRouter` component which builds `createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [pathname] })` + a stub root + child routes for all 4 paths (with `<Outlet>` rendering the wrapped fixture). `GalleryFixture` gains `routePath?: StubRoutePath`; the `shell-tab-navigation` fixture sets `routePath: '/library'` and its FIXME block is removed. `useMemo` deps intentionally omit `children` (one-mount-per-snapshot, no re-render churn needed — `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` suppressed with a deliberate comment); the `RouterProvider router={router as any}` cast is required because the stub router's typed tree is narrower than the main `routeTree.gen.ts` (runtime context lookup correct — `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` suppressed with a rationale comment). Regenerated 3 baselines `shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}-visual-darwin.png` now show `媒體庫` styled active. **Fix C (interactive `open` state via `openTrigger`)**: `GalleryState` union gains `'open'`; `GalleryFixture` gains `openTrigger?: string`; `gallery.tsx` filters out the `open` state when `!fx.openTrigger` (silent drop) and emits `data-gallery-open-trigger={fx.openTrigger}` on the `open` state div. The visual spec's new `else if (state === 'open')` branch reads the attribute, clicks the trigger inside the state div, then **`waitFor([role="listbox|menu|dialog"])` with 1 s timeout + `.catch` fallback** (the burn-in stabilizer — pre-`waitFor`, 1 visual fail in 4 burn-in runs; post-`waitFor`, 0 visual fails in 4 consecutive runs). `library-sort-selector` opted in (`statesOnly: ['default', 'hover', 'focus', 'open']` + `openTrigger: '[data-testid="sort-selector-button"]'`); new baseline `library-sort-selector/open-visual-darwin.png` captures the open `SortDropdown 955EZ` panel. **Deltas vs 19-4 closeout**: 26 fixture entries → 26 fixture entries (no new fixtures; SortSelector gains a state) / 27 entry-state combinations / **47 PNGs** (was 46: +1 new `library-sort-selector/open`, +4 re-blessed `shell-tab-navigation/{default,hover,focus}` and `search-search-bar/focus`). Regression: `eslint .` 0 errors / 122 warnings (matches 19-4 closeout EXACTLY), `prettier --check` clean on all 3 touched code files, `playwright test --project=visual --list` 1 test/1 file, feature-E2E `--list` 1663 tests / 36 files unchanged, `pnpm nx test web` 148 files / 1840 tests PASS, `pnpm nx test api` PASS (Nx-flagged known SSE flake, retried green — preexisting-fail-scanner-sse-scan-cancelled-flake; zero Go changes this story), `test:cleanup` no orphans after `test:cleanup:all` reaped 2 leftover Playwright nodes. 🔗 AC Drift: N/A (additive harness extension — gallery wrapper grammar gains optional `'open'` state + `data-gallery-open-trigger` attribute; SM CS pass classified as documented harness extension not stamped `[@contract-v1→v2]` bump on 19-4 AC #3; CR may re-classify). 📎 Contract Stamps: NONE this story (per SM judgment). 🔒 Rule 7 Wire Format: N/A (pure FE). 🎨 UX: PENDING Sally /test/gallery review — deferred to the Task 4 closure once Tasks 1–3 land the bulk fill. DEV inspector confirmation: `/test/gallery` rendered all 26 fixtures cleanly (no error placeholders); TabNavigation visibly highlights `媒體庫`; SortSelector `open` state captures the expanded panel with selected indicator on `新增日期`. ⚠️ Tasks 1–6 remain `[ ]` — story stays `in-progress`, NOT bumped to `review`. Per user instruction "task 0 only" scope. Commit message: `feat(19-4b): Task 0 harness-quality fixes — Sally follow-ups 1/2/3`. → Next session: pick up Task 1 (inventory + bucket P/Q/S/L) on a different LLM context per workflow tip. |
| 2026-05-13 | SM Bob /create-story (YOLO) COMPLETE. backlog → ready-for-dev. Story file: 19-4b-visual-baseline-bulk-fill.md (6 ACs; Task 0 with 3 fix sub-tasks + 6 numbered tasks covering inventory / presentational fill / data-driven fill / regen+UX-review+burn-in / Linux-baseline strategy / regression+close; ALL frontend / 0 backend → single story per cross-stack split check). Scope: (1) Task 0 lands the 3 Sally follow-ups from the 19-4 review — Fix A keyboard-Tab focus via sentinel, Fix B TabNavigation active-tab via nested memory `RouterProvider` (preferred) or sibling route, Fix C interactive `open` state via `openTrigger?` fixture field; regenerates the affected 19-4 focus baselines + adds `library-sort-selector/open`. (2) Tasks 1-3 inventory ~99 remaining `apps/web/src/components/**/*.tsx`, bucket into Presentational / Query-driven / Store-driven / Layout-shell, add fixture entries (reusing each component's `*.spec.tsx` mock shapes; `penNode` from the `// Implements:` header per `drift-19-3-2026-05.md`); extends the gallery infrastructure with `seedQueries?: Array<{ queryKey: readonly unknown[]; data: unknown }>` + `seedStore?: () => void` + `routePath?: string` additive fields on `GalleryFixture`. (3) Task 4 regenerates the full baseline set, Sally /ux-designer reviews `/test/gallery` (AC #3 close gate — mirrors 19-4's), burn-in `test:visual` ×5 = 0 flake. (4) Task 5 decides the Linux-baseline strategy 19-5 needs — `scripts/visual-baseline.sh` Docker helper OR documented CI-regen-on-first-run; updates `tests/visual/README.md` accordingly. (5) Task 6 updates `visual-baseline-19-4.md` "Delivered" table to the full set + closes the "Pending" section + full regression. 📎 Contract Stamps: NONE this story (the harness contracts are 19-4's `[@contract-v1]` AC #1–#5, consumed unchanged; `openTrigger?`/`seedQueries?`/`seedStore?`/`routePath?` are additive fixture-interface fields, not stamped contracts). 🔗 AC Drift: N/A (additive — no AC observable behaviour change on prior stories). 🔒 Rule 7 Wire Format: N/A (pure FE, no Go error codes). 🎨 UX: reads `ux-design.pen` mapping via the 19-3 audit doc only — no `.pen` modification, screenshot workflow not triggered. Depends on 19-4 (done — consumes harness; no Rule 20 ack needed, harness `[@contract-v1]` is consumed unchanged). Out of scope: CI workflow (19-5), component-vs-`.pen` diff sweep + `bugfix-N` filing (19-8), upgrading `<screen-section …>` placeholders (19-8), TestSprite (19-6/19-7), any `apps/web/src/components/` source edits. → DEV /dev-story next (use a different LLM than this SM session per workflow tip; run /code-review after with a third — and TEA *test-automate stays mostly N/A here since the visual spec IS the test). |
| 2026-05-12 | Created by the Story 19-4 Party Mode ruling (2026-05-12) — split out the bulk fixture/baseline fill (~99 components) so 19-4 could land the harness + ~25 reference components atomically (19-5 depends on the harness). backlog. |
