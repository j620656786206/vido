# 🎯 Enhanced Definition of Done Checklist

**Critical validation:** Story is truly ready for review only when ALL items below are satisfied

## 📋 Context & Requirements Validation

- [ ] **Story Context Completeness:** Dev Notes contains ALL necessary technical requirements, architecture patterns, and implementation guidance
- [ ] **Architecture Compliance:** Implementation follows all architectural requirements specified in Dev Notes
- [ ] **Technical Specifications:** All technical specifications (libraries, frameworks, versions) from Dev Notes are implemented correctly
- [ ] **Previous Story Learnings:** Previous story insights incorporated (if applicable) and build upon appropriately

## ✅ Implementation Completion

- [ ] **All Tasks Complete:** Every task and subtask marked complete with [x]
- [ ] **MANDATORY CHECKBOX AUDIT (Agreement 5, Epic 8 Retro):** Re-read the ENTIRE Tasks/Subtasks section of the story file from top to bottom. Count total `[ ]` (unchecked) items. If ANY unchecked items remain, either complete them or explicitly document why they are deferred. A story with unchecked tasks CANNOT be marked as done. This prevents the Story 8-8 failure where tasks were left unchecked but the story was declared complete.
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction:** Implementation satisfies EVERY Acceptance Criterion in the story
- [ ] **No Ambiguous Implementation:** Clear, unambiguous implementation that meets story requirements
- [ ] **Edge Cases Handled:** Error conditions and edge cases appropriately addressed
- [ ] **Dependencies Within Scope:** Only uses dependencies specified in story or project-context.md

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Unit tests added/updated for ALL core functionality introduced/changed by this story
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Integration tests added/updated for component interactions when story requirements demand them
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests created for critical user flows when story requirements specify them
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** Tests cover acceptance criteria and edge cases from story Dev Notes
- [ ] **Regression Prevention:** ALL existing tests pass (no regressions introduced)
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Linting and static checks pass when configured in project
- [ ] **Test Framework Compliance:** Tests use project's testing frameworks and patterns from Dev Notes

## 📝 Documentation & Tracking

- [ ] **File List Complete:** File List includes EVERY new, modified, or deleted file (paths relative to repo root)
- [ ] **Dev Agent Record Updated:** Contains relevant Implementation Notes and/or Debug Log for this work
- [ ] **Change Log Updated:** Change Log includes clear summary of what changed and why. Each implemented task should have a corresponding Change Log entry with date. (Epic 8 Retro: TD3/TD4 stories were implemented correctly but Change Log was empty — this check prevents that pattern.)
- [ ] **Review Follow-ups:** All review follow-up tasks (marked [AI-Review]) completed and corresponding review items marked resolved (if applicable)
- [ ] **Story Structure Compliance:** Only permitted sections of story file were modified

## 🎨 UX Design Verification (UI Stories Only)

- [ ] **Design Screenshots Compared:** All relevant design screenshots from `_bmad-output/screenshots/` reviewed against implementation
- [ ] **Layout Structure Match:** Element positioning, flex/grid arrangement, sidebar/overlay patterns match design
- [ ] **Spacing & Sizing Match:** Padding, margins, gaps, widths, heights match design specifications
- [ ] **Typography Match:** Font sizes, weights, colors for all text elements match design
- [ ] **Color Scheme Match:** Background, text, border, and accent colors match design palette
- [ ] **Component Styling Match:** Border radius, shadows, hover states, transitions match design
- [ ] **Content Labels Match:** Chinese text labels, button text, placeholders match design exactly
- [ ] **Discrepancies Fixed:** All identified gaps between design and implementation have been resolved
- [ ] **UX Verification Recorded:** Result (PASS/SKIPPED) recorded in Dev Agent Record

## 🔚 Final Status Verification

- [ ] **Story Status Updated:** Story Status set to "review"
- [ ] **Sprint Status Updated:** Sprint status updated to "review" (when sprint tracking is used)
- [ ] **Quality Gates Passed:** All quality checks and validations completed successfully
- [ ] **No HALT Conditions:** No blocking issues or incomplete work remaining
- [ ] **User Communication Ready:** Implementation summary prepared for user review

## 🎯 Final Validation Output

```
Definition of Done: {{PASS/FAIL}}

✅ **Story Ready for Review:** {{story_key}}
📊 **Completion Score:** {{completed_items}}/{{total_items}} items passed
🔍 **Quality Gates:** {{quality_gates_status}}
📋 **Test Results:** {{test_results_summary}}
📝 **Documentation:** {{documentation_status}}
```

**If FAIL:** List specific failures and required actions before story can be marked Ready for Review

**If PASS:** Story is fully ready for code review and production consideration
