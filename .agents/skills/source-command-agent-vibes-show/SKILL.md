# source-command-agent-vibes-show

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `agent-vibes-show`.

## Command Template

You are about to restore all hidden AgentVibes slash commands.

**What this does:**

- Moves all AgentVibes commands from `.claude/.agentvibes-backup/` back to `.claude/commands/agent-vibes/`
- Restores full command visibility
- Removes the hidden state flag
- All AgentVibes slash commands become visible again

**IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**

1. **Check if commands are hidden:**
   - Check if `.claude/.agentvibes-hidden.flag` exists
   - If it does NOT exist, respond: "⚠️ AgentVibes commands are already visible. Nothing to restore."
   - Stop execution

2. **Check if backup directory exists:**

   ```bash
   if [ ! -d ".claude/.agentvibes-backup" ]; then
     echo "⚠️ Backup directory not found. Commands may not have been properly hidden."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Restore all command files:**

   ```bash
   mv .claude/.agentvibes-backup/* .claude/commands/agent-vibes/
   rmdir .claude/.agentvibes-backup
   ```

4. **Remove the hidden state flag:**

   ```bash
   rm -f .claude/.agentvibes-hidden.flag
   ```

5. **Display success message:**

   ```
   ✅ AgentVibes commands restored successfully!

## MANUAL MIGRATION REQUIRED

Migrated from source command `agent-vibes-show` into a Codex skill. Invoke it as `$source-command-agent-vibes-show` and manually rewrite any slash-command behavior that depended on provider-specific runtime expansion.

Provider shell-output interpolation like ``!`command` `` was preserved as text; replace it with explicit Codex instructions to run the command when needed.
